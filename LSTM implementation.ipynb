The reopening was a very important event in the opinion of\\neverybody concerned, partly because it marked the beginning of a fresh\\nschool year, and partly because the building had been altered and\\nenlarged, many changes made in the curriculum, and many new names added\\nto the already long list in the register. Three hundred and eighty-seven\\npupils had assembled that morning in the great lecture hall, the largest\\nnumber on record at the College; five additional classes had been\\nformed, and there were six extra mistresses. At the eleven o\\'clock\\ninterval the place seemed swarming with girls; they thronged the\\nstaircase and passages, filled the pantry, blocked the dressing-rooms,\\nand overflowed into the playground and the gymnasium--girls of all sorts\\nand descriptions, from the ten-year-olds who had just come up (rather\\nsolemn and overawed) from the Preparatory to those elect and superior\\ndamsels of seventeen who were studying for their Matriculation.\\n\\nBy the empty stove in the Juniors\\' Common Room stood half a dozen\\n\"betwixt-and-betweens\", whose average age probably worked out at\\nfourteen and a quarter, though Mavie Morris was a giantess compared with\\nlittle Ruth Harmon. The six heads were bent together in closest\\nproximity, and the six tongues were particularly active, for after the\\nlong summer holidays there was such a vast amount to talk about that it\\nseemed almost impossible to discuss all the interesting items of news\\nwith sufficient rapidity.\\n\\n\"The old Coll. looks no end,\" said Grace Russell. \"It\\'s so smart and\\nspanky now--one hardly knows it! Pictures in the classrooms, flowers on\\nthe chimneypieces, a stained glass window in the lecture hall, busts on\\nbrackets all along the corridor wall, and the studio floor polished!\\nEvery single place has been done up from top to bottom.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d like it better if it didn\\'t smell so abominably of new paint,\"\\nobjected Noëlle Kennedy. \"When I opened the studio door, the varnish\\nstuck to my fingers. However, the school certainly looks much nicer.\\nWhy, even the book cupboard has been repapered.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s because you splashed ink on the wall last term. Don\\'t you\\nremember how fearfully cross Miss Hardy was about it?\"\\n\\n\"Rather! She insisted that I\\'d done it on purpose, and couldn\\'t and\\nwouldn\\'t believe it was an accident. Well, thank goodness we\\'ve done\\nwith her! I\\'m glad teachers don\\'t move up with their forms. I\\'m of the\\nopposite opinion to Hamlet, and I\\'d rather face the evils that I don\\'t\\nknow than those I do. Miss Pitman can\\'t possibly be any worse, and she\\nmay chance to be better.\"\\n\\n\"I say, it\\'s rather a joke our being in the Upper Fourth now, isn\\'t it?\"\\nremarked Ruth Harmon.\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad we\\'ve all gone up together,\" said Dorothy Greenfield. \"There\\'s\\nonly Marjory Poulton left behind, and she won\\'t be missed. We\\'re exactly\\nthe same old set, with the addition of a few new girls.\"\\n\\n\"Do you realize,\" said Mavie Morris, \"that we\\'re the top class in the\\nLower School now, and that one of us will be chosen Warden? There\\'ll be\\nan election this afternoon.\"\\n\\n\"Why, so there will! What a frantic excitement! We shall all have to\\ncanvass in the dinner-hour. I wonder if Miss Tempest has put up the\\nlist of candidates yet? I vote we go to the notice board and see;\\nthere\\'s just time before the bell rings.\"\\n\\nOff scrambled the girls at once, pushing and jostling one another in\\ntheir eagerness to get to the lecture hall. There was a crowd collected\\nround the notice board, but they elbowed their way to the front\\nnotwithstanding. Yes, the list was there, in the head mistress\\'s own\\nhandwriting, and they scanned it with varying comments of joy or\\ndisappointment, according as their names were present or absent.\\n\\n\"Hurrah!\"\\n\\n\"Disgusting!\"\\n\\n\"No luck for me!\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t call it fair!\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re on, Dorothy Greenfield, and so am I.\"\\n\\n\"I say, girls, which of you\\'ll promise to vote for me?\"\\n\\nAvondale College was a large day school. Its pupils were drawn from all\\nparts of Coleminster and the surrounding district, many coming in by\\ntrain or tramcar, and some on bicycles. Under the headmistress-ship of\\nMiss Tempest its numbers had increased so rapidly that extra\\naccommodation had become necessary; and not only had the lecture hall\\nand dressing-rooms been enlarged, but an entire new wing had been added\\nto the building. Avondale prided itself greatly upon its institutions.\\nIt is not always easy for a day school to have the same corporate life\\nas a boarding school; but Miss Tempest, in spite of this difficulty, had\\nmanaged to inaugurate a spirit of union among her pupils, and to make\\nthem work together for the general good of the community. She wished the\\nCollege to be, not merely a place where textbooks were studied, but a\\ncentral point of light on every possible subject. She encouraged the\\ngirls to have many interests outside the ordinary round of lessons, and\\nby the help of various self-governing societies to learn to be good\\ncitizens, and to play an intelligent and active part in the progress of\\nthe world. A Nature Study Union, a Guild of Arts and Crafts, a Debating\\nClub, a Dramatic Circle, and a School Magazine all flourished at\\nAvondale. The direction of these societies was in the hands of a select\\ncommittee chosen from the Fifth and Sixth Forms, but in order that the\\nyounger girls might be represented, a member of the Upper Fourth was\\nelected each year as \"Warden of the Lower School\", and was privileged to\\nattend some of the meetings, and to speak on behalf of the interests of\\nthe juniors.\\n\\nNaturally this post was an exceedingly coveted honour: the girl who held\\nit became the delegate and mouthpiece of the lower forms, an\\nacknowledged authority, and the general leader of the rest. It was the\\ncustom to elect the warden by ballot on the afternoon of the reopening\\nday. Six candidates were selected by Miss Tempest, and these were voted\\nfor by the members of the several divisions of the Third and Fourth\\nForms.\\n\\nAmong the six chosen for this election, none was more excited about her\\npossible chances than Dorothy Greenfield, and as our story centres round\\nher and her doings she merits a few words of description. She was a\\ntall, slim, rather out-of-the-common-looking girl, and though at present\\nshe was passing through the ugly duckling stage, she had several good\\npoints, which might develop into beauty later on. Her large dark grey\\neyes, with their straight, well-marked brows, made you forgive her\\nnondescript nose. She lacked colour, certainly, but her complexion was\\nclear, and, despite her rather thin cheeks, the outline of her face was\\ndecidedly pleasing. Her mouth was neat and firm, and her chin square;\\nand she had a quantity of wavy, fluffy brown hair that had an\\nobstreperous way of escaping from its ribbon and hanging over her ears.\\nDuring the past six months Dorothy had shot up like Jack\\'s beanstalk,\\nand she was still growing fast--an awkward process, which involved a\\ncertain angularity of both body and mind. She was apt to do things by\\nfits and starts; she formed hot attachments or took violent prejudices;\\nshe was amiable or irritable according to her mood, and though capable\\nof making herself most attractive, could flash out with a sharp retort\\nif anybody offended her. She had a favourable report in the school: she\\nwas generally among those marked \"excellent\" in her form, and she was\\nabove the average at hockey and tennis, had played a piano solo at the\\nannual concert, won \"highly commended\" at the Arts and Crafts\\nExhibition, and contributed an article to the School Magazine.\\n\\nPossessing such a good all-round record, therefore, Dorothy might have\\nas reasonable a possibility of success as anybody else at the coming\\nelection, and she could not help letting her hopes run high. The ballot\\nwas to be taken at half-past three, which left little time for\\ncanvassing; but she meant to do the best for herself that circumstances\\nwould allow. She was a day boarder, so, when morning classes were over,\\nshe strolled into the Juniors\\' Common Room to discuss her chances.\\nAlready some papers were pinned up claiming attention for the various\\ncandidates:\\n\\n\"Vote for Val Barnett, the hockey champion.\"\\n\\n\"Hope Lawson begs all her friends to support her in the coming\\nelection.\"\\n\\n\"Grace Russell solicits the favour of your votes.\"\\n\\n\"Noëlle Kennedy relies upon the kindness of the Lower School.\"\\n\\n\"Hallo, Dorothy!\" said Mavie Morris. \"Aren\\'t you going to add your quota\\nto the general lot? All the others are getting up their appeals. I wish\\nMiss Tempest had put me on the list of likelies!\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t think why she didn\\'t,\" replied Dorothy. \"I should say you\\'re\\nfar more suitable than Noëlle Kennedy.\"\\n\\n\"Why, so do I, naturally. But there! it can\\'t be helped. I\\'m not among\\nthe elect, so I must just grin and bear it. Is this your appeal? Let me\\nlook.\"\\n\\nShe seized the piece of paper from Dorothy\\'s hand, and, scanning it\\neagerly, read the following lines:\\n\\n    Ye voters at the school election,\\n    I beg you\\'ll look in my direction;\\n    I hate to boast and brag, but yet\\n    For once I\\'m blowing my own trumpet.\\n    Now don\\'t you think in me you\\'d find\\n    A candidate suited to your mind?\\n    No bookworm I, but fond of sports,\\n    Hockey or games of other sorts;\\n    At acting I can run the show,\\n    And play my part, as well you know.\\n    At meetings all your wants I\\'d state,\\n    And make a speech at the debate.\\n    I\\'d back in all scholastic storms\\n    The interests of the Lower Forms.\\n    A zealous leader I should be,\\n    So when you vote, please remember me!\\n    I hope these verses you will pardon,\\n    And choose me for the Lower School Warden.\\n\\n\"What do you think of it?\" asked Dorothy. \"I made it up during the\\nhistory lesson, and wrote it on my knee under the desk. One wants\\nsomething rather different from other people\\'s, and I thought perhaps no\\none else would have a rhyming address.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not bad,\" commented Mavie, \"but you do brag.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve apologized for it. One must state one\\'s qualifications, or what\\'s\\nthe use of being a candidate? Look at Val\\'s notice--she calls herself\\nthe hockey champion.\"\\n\\n\"No one takes Val too seriously. I don\\'t believe she\\'s the ghost of a\\nchance, though she did win the cup last season. One needs more than that\\nfor a warden; brains count as well as muscles.\"\\n\\n\"I know; that\\'s why I tried poetry.\"\\n\\n\"Please don\\'t call that stuff poetry. Half of the lines won\\'t scan.\"\\n\\nThere was a pucker between Dorothy\\'s dark eyebrows as she snatched back\\nher literary bantling.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t suppose that matters. Everybody isn\\'t so viper-critical,\" she\\nretorted. \"Shall I pin it up here or in the gym.?\"\\n\\n\"It will be more seen here; but I warn you, Dorothy, I don\\'t think the\\ngirls will like it.\"\\n\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s clever enough, but it\\'s cheeky. I\\'m afraid somehow it won\\'t\\ncatch on. If you take my advice, you\\'ll tear it up and just write \\'Vote\\nfor Dorothy Greenfield\\' instead.\"\\n\\nBut taking other people\\'s advice was not at present included in\\nDorothy\\'s scheme of existence; she much preferred her own ideas, however\\ncrude.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll leave it as it is,\" she answered loftily. \"It can\\'t fail to\\nattract attention anyhow.\"\\n\\n\"As you like. By the by, if you\\'re going round canvassing, there\\'s been\\na new----\"\\n\\nBut Dorothy did not wait to listen. She was annoyed at Mavie\\'s scant\\nappreciation of her poetic effort; and having manifested her\\nindependence by pinning the offending verses on the notice board, she\\nstalked away, trying to look nonchalant. She was determined to use every\\nmeans at hand to ensure success, and her best plan seemed to be to go\\nround personally soliciting votes.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tackle the dinner girls now,\" she thought, \"and I expect there\\'ll\\nbe just time to catch the others when they come back in the afternoon.\\nThank goodness the election is only among the Third and Fourth! It would\\nbe terrible if one had to go all round the school. Why, I never asked\\nMavie! How stupid! But she\\'s certain to be on my side; she detests Val,\\nand she\\'s not particularly fond of Hope either, though of course there\\'s\\nGrace. Had I better go back and make sure of her?\"\\n\\nOn the whole she decided that as she had left Mavie in rather a high and\\nmighty manner, it would seem a little beneath her dignity to return at\\nonce and beg a favour, so she went into the playground instead to beat\\nup possible electors. She was not the first in the field, by any means.\\nAlready Valentine Barnett and her satellites were hard at work coaxing\\nand wheedling, while the emissaries of Doris Earnshaw and Noëlle Kennedy\\nwere urging the qualifications of their particular favourites. Hope\\nLawson was seated on the see-saw in company with a number of small girls\\nfrom the Lower Second.\\n\\n\"What\\'s she doing that for?\" thought Dorothy. \"Those kids haven\\'t got\\nvotes. It\\'s sheer waste of time to bother with them. She\\'s actually put\\nher arm round that odious little Maggie Muir, and taken Nell Boughton on\\nher knee! I shouldn\\'t care to make myself so cheap. I suppose she\\'s\\nletting Blanche Hall and Irene Jackson do her canvassing for her.\"\\n\\nDorothy was, however, too much occupied with her own affairs to concern\\nherself greatly about her neighbours\\' movements. To put her claims\\nadequately before each separate elector was no mean task, and time fled\\nall too quickly. She used what powers of persuasion she possessed, and\\nflattered herself that she had made an impression in some quarters; but\\nvery few of the girls would give any definite promises. Many of them,\\nespecially those of the Middle and Lower Thirds, seemed to enjoy the\\nimportance of owning something which it was in their power to withhold.\\n\\n\"I\\'m waiting till I\\'ve heard what you all six have to say for\\nyourselves,\" said Kitty Palgrave condescendingly. \"I shan\\'t make up my\\nmind until the very last minute.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s so difficult to choose between you,\" added Ellie Simpson, a pert\\nlittle person of twelve.\\n\\nTheir tone verged on the offensive, and in any other circumstances\\nDorothy would have administered a snub. As it was, she pocketed her\\npride, and merely said she hoped they would remember her. She heard them\\nsnigger as she turned away, and longed to go back and shake them; but\\ndiscretion prevailed.\\n\\n\"One has to put up with this sort of thing if one wants to get returned\\nWarden,\" she reflected. \"All the same, it\\'s sickening to be obliged to\\ntruckle to young idiots like that.\"\\n\\nShe had not by any means found all the possible voters, so she decided\\nto return to the Juniors\\' Common Room. Mavie had gone, but a number of\\nother girls stood near the notice board talking, and reading the appeals\\nof the various candidates. Dorothy strolled up to see how her verses\\nwere being received. They made a different impression on different\\nminds, to judge from the comments that met her ears.\\n\\n\"It\\'s ripping!\" exclaimed Bertha Warren.\\n\\n\"Says she can run the show, does she?\" sneered Joyce Hickson.\\n\\n\"I call it just lovely!\" gushed Addie Parker.\\n\\n\"Her trumpeter\\'s dead, certainly!\" giggled Phyllis Fowler. \"Hallo,\\nDorothy! I didn\\'t see you were there.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to vote for you, Dorothy,\" said Bertha, \"and so is Addie.\\nPhyllis has promised Hope, and Joyce is on Val\\'s side. If you like, I\\'ll\\ncanvass for you here, while you do the gym. You\\'d better not waste any\\ntime, because the others are hard at it, and it\\'s best to get first\\ninnings if you can.\"\\n\\nDorothy hastily agreed, and hurried off to the gymnasium, where she was\\nfortunate enough to catch some of her own classmates. They were all\\nsucking enormous peppermint \"humbugs\", and were almost speechless in\\nconsequence; but they had the politeness to listen to her, which was\\nmore than she had experienced from some of the girls.\\n\\n\"Very sorry!\" replied Annie Gray, talking with difficulty. \"You should\\nhave asked us sooner. Val\\'s been round, and simply coerced us.\"\\n\\n\"She made it a hockey versus lacrosse contest, and of course we plumped\\nfor hockey,\" murmured Elsie Bellamy.\\n\\n\"Val\\'s simply ripping at hockey!\"\\n\\n\"Is that all you care for?\" exclaimed Dorothy scornfully. \"Val has\\nnothing else to recommend her.\"\\n\\n\"Hasn\\'t she? What about peppermint \\'humbugs\\'? I call them a very\\nsubstantial recommendation.\"\\n\\n\"Did Val give you those?\"\\n\\n\"Rather! She put on her hat and bolted out into High Street and bought a\\nwhole pound. Lucky Miss James didn\\'t catch her as she dodged back!\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s handing them round to everybody,\" added Helen Walker. \"I wish I\\nhad taken two.\"\\n\\nFor once Dorothy\\'s pale cheeks put on a colour. She could not restrain\\nher indignation.\\n\\n\"How atrociously and abominably mean!\" she burst out. \"Why, it\\'s just\\nbribery, pure and simple. I didn\\'t think Val was capable of such a\\nsneaking trick. She knows quite well how unfair it is to the rest of\\nus.\"\\n\\n\"Why, you could have done the same if you\\'d liked,\" laughed Elsie. \"It\\'s\\nnot too late now. I\\'ve a preference for caramels, if you ask me.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d be ashamed!\" declared Dorothy. \"Surely you ought to give your votes\\non better grounds than \\'humbugs\\' or caramels? Such a thing has never\\nbeen done before at the Coll.\"\\n\\n\"All the more loss for us,\" giggled Helen flippantly.\\n\\n\"Do you mean to tell me you don\\'t care whether a candidate behaves\\ndishonourably or not?\"\\n\\n\"Not I, if she\\'s jolly.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m disgusted with you, absolutely disgusted! If you haven\\'t a higher\\nideal of what\\'s required in a warden, you don\\'t deserve to have votes at\\nall.\"\\n\\n\"Draw it mild, Dorothy!\" chirped Elsie.\\n\\n\"I won\\'t. I\\'ll tell you what I think of you: you\\'re a set of greedy\\nthings! There isn\\'t one of you with a spark of public spirit, and if the\\nelection is going to be run on these lines, I----\"\\n\\nBut Dorothy\\'s tirade was interrupted by the dinner bell; and the objects\\nof her scorn, hastily swallowing the offending peppermints, decamped at\\na run, leaving her to address a group of empty chairs. She followed more\\nleisurely, fuming as she went. She knew she had been foolish and most\\nundiplomatic to lose her temper so utterly, but the words had rushed out\\nbefore she could stop them.\\n\\n\"They wouldn\\'t have voted for me in any case,\" she said to herself, \"so\\nit really doesn\\'t matter, after all, they\\'re only a minority. I expect\\nit will prove a very even affair, perhaps a draw, and that no one will\\nhave a complete walk-over.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nWhat Dorothy Overheard\\n\\n\\nAt half-past three, exactly in the middle of the French reading-lesson,\\nMiss James, the school secretary, entered the Upper Fourth room with a\\nsheaf of voting papers in her hand. These were dealt round to all the\\ngirls, with the exception of the candidates, and Miss James gave a brief\\nexplanation of what was required.\\n\\n\"On each paper you will find six names. You must put a cross to the one\\nyou wish to choose for your warden. Do not write anything at all, but\\nfold the paper and hand it in to Miss Pitman, who will place it in this\\nbox, which I shall call for in five minutes.\"\\n\\nSo saying, she bustled away in a great hurry to perform a similar errand\\nin the next classroom. The six candidates tried to sit looking\\ndisinterested and unconscious while their fates were being decided. Hope\\nLawson hunted out words in the dictionary, Valentine Barnett made a\\nparade of arranging the contents of her pencil box, and the others\\nopened books and began preparation. Not a word was allowed to be\\nspoken. In dead silence the girls recorded their crosses and handed in\\ntheir papers, and the last was hardly dropped into the ballot box before\\nMiss James reappeared. The result of the election was to be announced at\\nfour o\\'clock, therefore there were still twenty minutes of suspense.\\nMiss Pitman went on with the French reading as if nothing had happened,\\nand Dorothy made a gallant effort to fix her attention on _Le Jeune\\nPatriote_, and to forget that Miss Tempest and Miss James were hard at\\nwork in the library counting votes. Nobody\\'s translation was\\nparticularly brilliant that afternoon; everyone was watching the clock\\nand longing for the end of the lesson. When the bell rang there was a\\ngeneral scuffle; books were seized and desk lids banged, and though Miss\\nPitman called the Form to order and insisted upon a decorous exit from\\nthe room, the girls simply pelted down the stairs to the lecture hall.\\nIn a few moments the whole school had assembled. There was not long to\\nwait, for exactly at the stroke of four Miss Tempest walked on to the\\nplatform and made the brief announcement:\\n\\n\"Hope Lawson has been elected Warden of the Lower School by a majority\\nof fifty votes.\"\\n\\nDorothy left the lecture hall with her head in a whirl. That Hope should\\nhave won by such an enormous majority was most astonishing. She could\\nnot understand it. Conversation was strictly forbidden on the staircase,\\nbut the moment she reached the gymnasium door she burst into eager\\nenquiries.\\n\\n\"Yes, it\\'s a surprise to everybody,\" said Ruth Harmon. \"I thought myself\\nthat Val would get it. All the Lower Fourth and most of the Upper Third\\nwere for her.\"\\n\\n\"Then how could Hope possibly score by fifty?\"\\n\\n\"She did it with the kids, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\"But the First and Second weren\\'t voting?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed they were! Do you mean to say you never knew? Why, Miss James\\ngave it out this morning.\"\\n\\n\"Of all sells!\" gasped Dorothy. \"I heard nothing about it! It\\'s the\\nfirst year those kids have ever taken part in the election. Why couldn\\'t\\nsome of you tell me?\"\\n\\n\"I was just going to,\" said Mavie, \"but you stalked away and wouldn\\'t\\nlisten. It\\'s your own fault, Dorothy.\"\\n\\n\"You might have run after me.\"\\n\\n\"You looked so lofty, I didn\\'t feel disposed.\"\\n\\n\"Val didn\\'t know either,\" interposed Bertha Warren. \"She never canvassed\\nin the First or the Second; no more did Grace or Noëlle. I\\'m not certain\\nif any of you knew except Hope. Only a few were in the room when Miss\\nJames gave it out.\"\\n\\n\"Then she\\'s taken a most mean advantage,\" said Dorothy. \"I understand\\nnow why she was sitting on the see-saw making herself so extremely\\npleasant. It\\'s not fair! Miss James ought to have announced to the whole\\nschool that such a change had been made.\"\\n\\n\"Go and tell her so!\" sneered Phyllis Fowler.\\n\\n\"Those who lose always call things unfair,\" added Joyce Hickson.\\n\\nDorothy walked away without another word. She did not wish to be\\nconsidered jealous, and her common sense told her that she had already\\nsaid more than enough. She was too proud to ask for sympathy, and felt\\nthat her most dignified course was to accept her defeat in silence. She\\nthought she would rather not speak even to her friends, so, ignoring\\nviolent signals from Bertha Warren and Addie Parker, she went at once to\\nput on her outdoor clothes. The dressing-room, to provide greater\\naccommodation, had not only hooks round the walls, but double rows of\\nhat-stands down the middle, with lockers for boots underneath. As\\nDorothy sat changing her shoes, she could hear three girls talking on\\nthe other side of the hat-stand, though, owing to the number of coats\\nwhich were hanging up, the speakers were hidden from her. She recognized\\ntheir voices, however, perfectly well.\\n\\n\"I\\'m rather surprised at Hope getting it,\" Helen Walker was saying. \"I\\nthought Val was pretty safe. I voted for her, of course.\"\\n\\n\"A good many voted for Dorothy,\" replied Evie Fenwick.\\n\\n\"I know. I thought she might have had a chance even against Val. She\\'ll\\nbe dreadfully disgusted.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m very glad Hope was chosen,\" said Agnes Lowe. \"After all, she\\'s far\\nthe most suitable for Warden; she\\'s ever so much cleverer than Val.\"\\n\\n\"But not more than Dorothy!\"\\n\\n\"No; but she\\'s a girl of better position, and that counts for something.\\nHer father was Mayor last year, and her mother is quite an authority on\\neducation, and speaks at meetings.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Dorothy\\'s aunt writes articles for magazines. One often sees the\\nname \\'Barbara Sherbourne\\' in the newspapers. Dorothy\\'s tremendously\\nproud of her.\"\\n\\n\"Dorothy needn\\'t take any credit to herself on that account,\" returned\\nAgnes, \"for, as it happens, Miss Sherbourne isn\\'t her aunt at all; she\\'s\\nno relation.\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure?\"\\n\\n\"Absolutely. I know for a fact that Dorothy is nothing but a waif, a\\nnobody, who is being brought up for charity. Miss Sherbourne adopted her\\nwhen she was a baby.\"\\n\\nAt this most astounding piece of information, Dorothy, who had followed\\nthe conversation without any thought of eavesdropping, flung her\\nslippers into her locker and stalked round to the other side of the\\nhat-stand.\\n\\n\"Agnes Lowe, what do you mean by telling such an absolute story?\" she\\nasked grimly.\\n\\n\"I\\'d no idea you were there!\" returned Agnes.\\n\\n\"Listeners never hear any good of themselves,\" laughed Helen.\\n\\n\"I\\'m extremely glad I overheard. It gives me a chance to deny such\\nrubbish. I shall expect Agnes to make an instant apology.\"\\n\\nDorothy\\'s tone was aggressive; she waited with a glare in her eyes and a\\ndetermined look about her mouth. Agnes did not flinch, however.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry you heard what I said, Dorothy,\" she replied. \"It wasn\\'t\\nmeant for you; but it\\'s true, all the same, and I can\\'t take back my\\nwords.\"\\n\\n\"How can it be true?\"\\n\\nAgnes put on her hat hastily and seized her satchel.\\n\\n\"You\\'d better ask Miss Sherbourne. Probably everyone in Hurford knows\\nabout it except yourself. Come, Helen, I\\'m ready now,\" and she hurried\\naway with her two friends, evidently anxious to escape further\\nquestioning.\\n\\nDorothy took up her pile of home-lesson books and followed them; but\\nthey must have raced down the passage, for when she reached the door\\nthey were already disappearing round the corner of the playground. It\\nwas useless to think of pursuing them; she had barely time, as it was,\\nto catch her train, and she must walk fast if she meant to be at the\\nstation by half-past four. She scurried along High Street, keeping a\\nwatchful eye on the town hall clock in the intervals of dodging\\npassengers on the pavements and dashing recklessly over crossings. At\\nStation Road she quickened her footsteps to a run, and tore up the\\nflight of stairs that was the shortest cut to the ticket office.\\nFortunately she possessed a contract, so she had no further delay, and\\nwas able to scuttle across the platform into the Hurford train. The\\nguard, who knew her well by sight, smiled as he slammed the door of her\\ncompartment.\\n\\n\"A near shave to-day, missy! I see you\\'re back at school,\" he remarked,\\nthen waved his green flag.\\n\\nDorothy sank down breathlessly. To miss the 4.30 would have meant\\nwaiting three-quarters of an hour--a tiresome experience which she had\\ngone through before, and had no desire to repeat. She was lucky,\\ncertainly; but now that the anxiety of catching the train was over, the\\nreaction came, and she felt both tired and cross. What an enormously\\nlong time it seemed since she had started that morning, and what a\\nhorrid day it had been! She leaned back in a corner of the compartment\\nand took a mental review of everything that had happened at school: her\\nexpectation of winning the election, her canvassing among the girls,\\ntheir many ill-natured remarks, Val\\'s method of bribery, and Hope\\'s\\nunfair advantage. She was bitterly chagrined at missing the wardenship,\\nand the thought that she might have had a chance of success if she had\\nknown of the voting powers of the First and Second Forms only added to\\nher disappointment. She was indignant and out of temper with Mavie, with\\nHope, with the whole of her little world; everything had seemed to go\\nwrong, and, to crown all, Agnes Lowe had dared to call her a nobody and\\na charity child! What could Agnes mean? It was surely a ridiculously\\nfalse accusation, made from spite or sheer love of teasing. She, Dorothy\\nGreenfield, a waif! The idea was impossible. Why, she had always prided\\nherself upon her good birth! The Sherbournes were of knightly race, and\\ntheir doings were mentioned in the county history of Devonshire as far\\nback as Queen Elizabeth\\'s reign. Of course, her name was Greenfield, not\\nSherbourne; but she was of the same lineage, and she had pasted the\\nfamily crest inside her school books. She would trace out her pedigree\\nthat very evening right to Sir Thomas Sherbourne, who helped to fit out\\na ship to fight the Armada; and she would take a copy to school\\nto-morrow and show it to Agnes, who could not fail to be convinced by\\nsuch positive evidence. Yes, the girls should see that, far from being a\\nnobody, she was really of a better family than Hope Lawson, whose claims\\nto position rested solely on her father\\'s public services to the city of\\nColeminster.\\n\\nAnd yet under all her assurance there lurked an uneasy sensation of\\ndoubt. She had taken it for granted that her mother was a Sherbourne;\\nbut she remembered now that when she had spoken of her as such, Aunt\\nBarbara had always evaded the subject. Nobody ever mentioned her\\nparents. She had thought it was because they were dead; but surely that\\nwas not a sufficient reason for the omission? Could there be another and\\na stronger motive for thus withholding all knowledge about them? Several\\nthings occurred to her--hints that had been dropped by Martha, the maid,\\nwhich, though not comprehended, had remained in her memory--looks,\\nglances, half-spoken sentences let fall by Aunt Barbara\\'s friends--a\\nhundred nothings too small in themselves to be noticed, but, counted in\\nthe aggregate, quite sufficient to strengthen the unwelcome suspicion\\nthat had suddenly awakened.\\n\\n\"Rubbish!\" thought Dorothy, with an effort to dispel the black shadow.\\n\"I\\'ll ask Aunt Barbara, and I\\'ve no doubt she\\'ll easily explain it all\\nand set everything right.\"\\n\\nBy this time the train had passed Ash Hill, Burnlea, and Latchworth, and\\nhad arrived at Hurford, Dorothy\\'s station. She stepped out of the\\ncompartment, so preoccupied with her reflections that she would have\\nforgotten her books, if a fellow-passenger had not handed them to her.\\nShe scarcely noticed the Rector and his children, who were standing on\\nthe platform, and, turning a deaf ear to the youngest boy, who called to\\nher to wait for them, she hurried off alone along the road.\\n\\nIt was a pleasant walk to her home, between green hedges, and with a\\nview of woods and distant hills. Hurford was quite a country place, and\\ncould boast of thatched cottages, a market cross, and a pair of stocks,\\nalthough it lay barely twelve miles from the great manufacturing city of\\nColeminster. Dorothy\\'s destination was a little, quaint, old-fashioned\\nstone house that stood close by the roadside at the beginning of the\\nvillage street. A thick, well-clipped holly hedge protected from prying\\neyes a garden where summer flowers were still blooming profusely, a\\nstrip of lawn was laid out for croquet, and a small orchard, at the\\nback, held a moderate crop of pears and apples. Dorothy ran in through\\nthe creeper-covered porch, slammed her books on the hall table, then,\\ndescending two steps, entered the low-ceiled, oak-panelled dining-room,\\nand rushed to fling her arms round a lady who was sitting doing fancy\\nwork near the open window.\\n\\n\"Here I am at last, Auntie! Oh, I feel as if I hadn\\'t seen you for a\\nhundred years! I\\'m in the Upper Fourth, but it\\'s been a hateful day. I\\nnever thought school was so horrid before. I\\'m very disappointed and\\ndisgusted and abominably cross.\"\\n\\n\"Poor little woman! What\\'s the matter?\" said Aunt Barbara, taking\\nDorothy\\'s face in her hands, as the girl knelt by her side, and trying\\nto kiss away the frown that rested there. \"You certainly don\\'t look as\\nif you had been enjoying yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Enjoying myself? I should think not! We had an election for the\\nwardenship, and my name was on the list, and I might perhaps have won if\\nthe others hadn\\'t been so mean; but I didn\\'t, and Hope Lawson has got\\nit!\"\\n\\n\"We can\\'t always win, can we? Never mind! It\\'s something that your name\\nwas on the list of candidates. All the girls who lost will be feeling\\nequally disappointed. Suppose you just forget about it, go and take off\\nyour things, and tell Martha to make some buttered toast.\"\\n\\nDorothy laughed. Already her face had lost its injured and woeful\\nexpression.\\n\\n\"That\\'s as good as saying: \\'Don\\'t make a fuss about nothing\\'. All right,\\nAuntie, I\\'m going. But I warn you that this is only a respite, and I\\nmean to give you a full and detailed list of all my particular\\ngrievances after tea. So make up your mind to it, and brace your dear\\nnerves!\"\\n\\nMiss Barbara Sherbourne was a most charming personality. She was young\\nenough to be still very pretty and attractive, but old enough to take\\nbroad views of life, and to have attained that independence of action\\nwhich is the prerogative of middle age. She was a clever and essentially\\na cultured woman; she had lived abroad in her youth, and the glamour of\\nold Italian cities and soft, southern skies still seemed to cling to\\nher. She was a good amateur musician, could sketch a little, and had\\nlately obtained some success in writing. Ever since Dorothy could\\nremember, she and Aunt Barbara and Martha, the maid, had lived together\\nat Holly Cottage, a particularly harmonious trio, liking their own mode\\nof life, and quite independent of the outside world. The little house\\nseemed to fit its inmates, and, in spite of its small accommodation, to\\nprovide just what was wanted for each. First there was the old-fashioned\\ndining-room, with its carved oak furniture, blue china, and rows of\\nshining pewter; its choice prints on the walls, its bookshelves,\\noverflowing with interesting volumes; and the desk where Aunt Barbara\\nwrote in the mornings--a room that seemed made especially for comfort,\\nand reached its acme of cosiness on a cold winter\\'s day, when\\narm-chairs were drawn up to the blazing fire that burnt in the quaint\\ndog grate. Then there was the little drawing-room, with its piano and\\nmusic rack, and its great Japanese cabinet, full of all kinds of\\ntreasures from foreign places. When Dorothy was a tiny girl it had been\\nher Sunday afternoon treat to be allowed to investigate the mysteries of\\nthis cabinet, to open its numerous drawers and sliding panels, and to\\nturn over the miscellaneous collection of things it contained; and she\\nstill regarded it in the light of an old friend. The artistic\\ndecorations, the chintz hangings, the water-colour paintings of Italian\\nscenes, all helped to give an æsthetic effect to the room, and to make a\\nvery pleasant whole. The kitchen was, of course, Martha\\'s particular\\ndomain, but even here there were books and pictures, and a table\\nreserved for writing desk and work basket. I fear Martha did not often\\nbusy herself with pens and paper, for she held head-learning in\\ngood-natured contempt; but she appreciated her mistress\\'s effort to make\\nher comfortable, and polished the brass-topped inkpot diligently, if she\\nseldom used it. Peterkin, the grey Persian cat, generally sat in the\\narm-chair, or on Martha\\'s knee, which he much preferred, when he got the\\nchance; and Draco, the green parrot, hobbled up and down his perch at\\nthe sunny window, repeating his stock of phrases, begging for titbits,\\nor imitating smacking kisses.\\n\\nJust at the top of the stairs was Dorothy\\'s special sanctum. It had\\nformerly been her nursery, and still contained her old dolls\\' house, put\\naway in a corner, though her toys were now replaced by schoolgirl\\npossessions. Here she kept her tennis racket, her hockey stick, her\\ncamera and photographic materials, her collections of stamps, crests,\\nand picture postcards; there was a table where she could use paste or\\nglue, or indulge in various sticky performances forbidden in the\\ndining-room, and a cupboard where oddments could be stored without the\\npainful necessity of continually keeping them tidily arranged. She could\\ntry experiments in sweet making, clay modelling, bookbinding, or any of\\nthe other arts and crafts that were represented at the annual school\\nexhibition; in fact, it was a dear, delightful \"den\", where she could\\nconduct operations without being obliged to move her things away, and\\nmight make a mess in defiance of Martha\\'s chidings.\\n\\nDorothy often took a peep into her sanctum on her return from Avondale,\\nbut to-day she ran straight to her bedroom. She was anxious to finish\\ntea and have a talk with Aunt Barbara. She felt she could not rest until\\nshe had mentioned Agnes Lowe\\'s remarks, and either proved or disproved\\ntheir truth. It was not a question that she could raise, however, when\\nMartha was coming into and going out of the dining-room with hot water\\nand toast; and it was only after she had cajoled Miss Sherbourne to the\\nprivacy of the summer-house, and had related her other school woes, that\\nthe girl ventured to broach the subject.\\n\\n\"I know it\\'s nonsense, Auntie, but I thought I\\'d like to tell you, all\\nthe same,\" she concluded, and waited for a denial with a look of anxiety\\nin her eyes that belied her words.\\n\\nMiss Sherbourne did not at once reply. Apparently she was considering\\nwhat answer to make.\\n\\n\"I knew you would ask me this some day, Dorothy,\" she said at last. \"It\\nseemed unnecessary for you to know before, but you are growing older so\\nfast that it is time you learnt your own story.\"\\n\\nDorothy turned her face sharply away. She did not want even Aunt Barbara\\nto see how her mouth was quivering.\\n\\n\"Is it true, then?\" she asked, in a strangled voice.\\n\\n\"Yes, dear child. In a sense it is all absolutely true.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nA Retrospect\\n\\n\\nMore than thirteen years before this story begins, Miss Barbara\\nSherbourne happened to be travelling on the Northern Express from\\nMiddleford to Glasebury. She had chosen a corner of the compartment with\\nher back to the engine, had provided herself with books and papers, had\\nordered a cup of afternoon tea to be brought from the restaurant car\\nprecisely at four o\\'clock, and had put a piece of knitting in her\\nhandbag with which to occupy herself in case she grew tired of reading\\nor watching the landscape. After these preparations she anticipated a\\ncomfortable journey, and she leaned back in her corner feeling at peace\\nwith herself and all the world. Her fellow-passengers consisted of two\\nold ladies, evidently returning home after a holiday in the South; a\\nmorose-looking man with a bundle of Socialist tracts, and a middle-aged\\nwoman, who, with a baby on her knee, occupied the opposite corner.\\nNobody spoke a word, except an occasional necessary one about the\\nopening or closing of a window, and all settled down to read books and\\npapers, or to enjoy the luxury of a snooze while the train sped swiftly\\nnorthwards. The baby was sleeping peacefully, its lips parted, its long\\nlashes resting on its flushed cheeks, and one little hand flung out from\\nunder the white woolly shawl which was wrapped closely round it. It made\\na pretty picture as it lay thus, and Miss Sherbourne\\'s eyes returned\\nagain and again to dwell on the soft lines of the chubby neck and\\ndimpled chin. She was fond of studying her fellow-creatures, and she\\ncould not quite reconcile the appearance of the child with that of the\\nwoman who held it in her arms. The latter was plainly though tidily\\ndressed, and did not look like an educated person. There was nothing of\\nrefinement in her face: the features were heavy, the mouth even a trifle\\ncoarse. Her gloveless hands were work-worn, and her wedding ring was of\\na cheap gold. The general impression she gave was that of a superior\\nworking woman, or the wife of a small tradesman. The baby did not\\nresemble her in the least: it was fair, and pretty, and daintily kept,\\nits bonnet and coat and the shawl in which it was wrapped were of finest\\nquality, and the tiny boot that lay on the carriage seat was a silk one.\\n\\nMiss Barbara could not help speculating about the pair. She amused\\nherself first with vainly trying to trace a likeness, then with\\nwondering whether the woman were really the mother of the child, and if\\nso, how she managed to dress it so well, and whether she realized that\\nits clothes looked out of keeping with her own attire. Finally she gave\\nup guessing, in sheer despair of arriving at any possible conclusion.\\n\\nThe train had been ten minutes late in starting, and was making up for\\nlost time by an increase in speed as it dashed across a tract of\\nmoorland. The oscillation was most marked, and walls and telegraph posts\\nseemed to fly past so quickly as to dazzle the sight. Miss Sherbourne\\nclosed her eyes; the whirling landscape made her head ache, and the\\nswaying of the carriage had become very unpleasant. She took hold of the\\nstrap to steady herself, and was debating whether it would be better to\\nclose the rattling window, when, without further warning, there came a\\nsudden and awful crash, the impact of which hurled the baby on to her\\nknee, and telescoped the walls of the compartment. For a few seconds she\\nwas stunned with the shock. When she recovered consciousness she found\\nherself lying on her side under a pile of wreckage, instinctively\\nclutching the little child in her arms. She moved her limbs cautiously,\\nand satisfied herself that she was unhurt; part of the roof had fallen\\nslantwise, and by so doing had just saved her from injury, penning her\\nin a corner of the overturned carriage. The smashed window was\\nunderneath, about eighteen inches above the ground, for the train in\\ntoppling over had struck a wall, and lay at an inclined angle.\\n\\nFrom all around came piteous groans and cries for help, but Miss\\nSherbourne could see nobody, the broken woodwork cutting her off\\ncompletely from the rest of the compartment. The baby in her arms was\\nscreaming with fright. Fortunately for herself, she preserved presence\\nof mind and a resourceful brain. She did not lose her head in this\\nemergency, and her first idea was to find some means of escape. She\\nstretched out her hand and broke away the pieces of shivered glass till\\nthe window beneath her was free; then, still clasping the child, she\\nmanaged to crawl through the opening on to the line below. So narrow was\\nthe space between the ground and the wreckage above her that she was\\nforced to lie flat and writhe herself along. It was a slow and painful\\nprogress, and the light was so dim that she could scarcely see, while at\\nany moment she expected to find her way blocked by fallen woodwork. Yet\\nthat was her one chance of safety, and at any cost she must persevere.\\nShe never knew how far she crawled; to her it seemed miles, though\\nprobably it was no greater distance than the length of the carriage: but\\nat last she spied daylight, and, struggling through a hole above her\\nhead, she climbed over the ruins of a luggage compartment, and so on to\\nthe bank of grass edging the line.\\n\\nThe wind was blowing strongly over the moor, so strongly that she had\\ndifficulty in keeping her feet as she staggered into the shelter of the\\nwall. The scene before her was one of horror and desolation. She saw at\\nonce the cause of the accident--the express had dashed into an advancing\\ntrain, and the two engines lay smashed by the terrific force of the\\ncollision. A few passengers who, like herself, had managed to make their\\nescape stood by the line--some half-dazed and staring helplessly, others\\nalready attempting to rescue those who were pinned under the wreckage.\\nThe guard, his face livid and streaming with blood, was running to the\\nnearest signal box to notify the disaster, and some labourers were\\nhurrying from a group of cottages near, bringing an axe and a piece of\\nrope. To the end of her life Miss Barbara will never recall without a\\nshudder the pathetic sights she witnessed as the injured were dragged\\nfrom the splintered carriages. But the worst was yet to come. Almost\\nimmediately a cry of \"Fire!\" was raised, and the flames, starting from\\none of the overturned engines and fanned by the furious wind, gained a\\nfierce hold on the broken woodwork, which flared up and burned like\\ntinder.\\n\\n\"Come awa\\'!\" screamed a countrywoman, seizing Miss Sherbourne almost\\nroughly by the arm. \"You with a bairn! Bring it to our hoose yonder out\\no\\' the wind. The men are doing a\\' they can, and we canna help \\'em. It\\'s\\nno fit sight for women. Come, I tell ye! Th\\' train\\'s naught but a\\nblazin\\' bonfire, and them as is under it\\'s as good as gone. Don\\'t look!\\nDon\\'t look! Come, in the Lord\\'s name!\"\\n\\n\"Then may He have mercy on their souls!\" said Miss Barbara, as with\\nbowed head she allowed herself to be led away.\\n\\nThe news of the accident was telegraphed down the line, and as speedily\\nas possible a special train, bearing doctors and nurses, arrived on the\\nspot. The sufferers were carried to the little village of Greenfield,\\nclose by, and attended to at once, some who were well enough to travel\\ngoing on by a relief train, while others who were more seriously injured\\nremained until they could communicate with their friends. The fire,\\nmeanwhile, had done its fatal work, and little was left of any of the\\ncarriages but heaps of charred ashes. Those who had escaped\\ncomparatively unhurt had, with the aid of the few farm labourers who\\nwere near at the time, worked with frantic and almost superhuman\\nendeavour to rescue any fellow-passengers within their reach; but they\\nhad at last been driven back by the fury of the flames and forced to\\nabandon their heroic task. No one could even guess the extent of the\\ndeath roll. From the extreme rapidity with which the fire had taken\\nhold and spread, it was feared that many must have perished under the\\nwreckage, but their names could not be ascertained until the news of the\\ndisaster was spread over the country, and their friends reported them as\\nmissing.\\n\\nTwenty-four hours later Miss Barbara Sherbourne sat in the parlour of\\nthe Red Lion Hotel at Greenfield. She had remained there partly because\\nshe was suffering greatly from shock, and partly because she felt\\nresponsible for the welfare of the little child whom she had been able\\nto save. The account of its rescue was circulated in all the morning\\npapers, so she expected that before long some relation would arrive to\\nclaim it. The woman who had accompanied it was not among the list of the\\nrescued, and Miss Barbara shuddered afresh at the remembrance of the\\nburning carriages.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a bonnie bairn, too, and takes wonderful notice,\" said Martha,\\nMiss Sherbourne\\'s faithful maid, for whom she had telegraphed. \"Those to\\nwhom it belongs will be crazy with joy to find it safe. Dear, dear! To\\nthink its poor mother has gone, and to such an awful death!\"\\n\\nThe baby girl was indeed the heroine of the hour. The story of her\\nwonderful escape appealed to everybody; newspaper reporters took\\nsnapshots of her, and many people begged to be allowed to see her out of\\nsheer curiosity or interest. So far, though she had been interviewed\\nalmost continuously from early morning, not one among the numbers who\\nvisited her recognized her in the least. Fortunately she was of a\\nfriendly disposition, and though she had had one or two good cries, she\\nseemed fairly content to be nursed by strangers, and took readily to the\\nbottle that was procured for her. At about six o\\'clock Miss Barbara and\\nMartha sat alone with her in the inn parlour. The afternoon train had\\ndeparted, bearing with it most of yesterday\\'s sufferers and their\\nfriends, so it was hardly to be expected that any more visitors would\\narrive that evening. The baby sat on Miss Barbara\\'s knee, industriously\\nexercising the only two wee teeth it possessed upon an ivory needlecase\\nsupplied from Martha\\'s pocket. Outside the light was fading, and rain\\nwas beginning to fall, so the bright fire in the grate was the more\\nattractive.\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad we didn\\'t attempt to go home to-night, Martha,\" said Miss\\nSherbourne. \"I expect I shall feel better to-morrow, and I shall leave\\nmuch more comfortably when this little one has been claimed. No doubt\\nsomebody will turn up for her in the morning. It\\'s too late for anyone\\nelse to come to-day.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s a carriage arriving now,\" replied Martha, rising and going to\\nthe window. \"Somebody\\'s getting out of it. Yes, and she\\'s coming in\\nhere, too, I verily believe.\"\\n\\nMartha was not mistaken. A moment afterwards the door was opened, and\\nthe landlord obsequiously ushered in a stranger. The lady was young, and\\nhandsomely dressed in deep mourning. Her face was fair and pretty,\\nthough it showed signs of the strongest agitation. She was deadly pale,\\nher eyes had a strained expression, and her lips twitched nervously.\\nWithout a word of introduction or explanation she walked straight to the\\nchild, and stood gazing at it with an intensity which it was painful to\\nbehold, catching her breath as if speech failed her.\\n\\n\"Do you recognize her?\" asked Miss Barbara anxiously, turning her\\nnursling so that the light from the lamp fell full on its chubby face.\\n\\n\"No! No!\" gasped the stranger. \"I don\\'t know it. I can\\'t tell whose it\\nis in the least.\"\\n\\nShe averted her face as she spoke; her mouth was quivering, and her\\nhands trembled.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve lost a baby of this age in the accident, maybe?\" enquired\\nMartha.\\n\\n\"No; I have lost nobody. I only thought--I expected----\" She spoke\\nwildly, almost hysterically, casting swift, uneasy glances at the child,\\nand as quickly turning away her eyes.\\n\\n\"You expected?\" said Miss Sherbourne interrogatively, for the stranger\\nhad broken off in the middle of the sentence.\\n\\n\"Nothing--nothing at all! I\\'m sorry to have troubled you. I must go at\\nonce, for my carriage is waiting.\"\\n\\n\"Then you don\\'t know the child?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t,\" the stranger repeated emphatically; \"not in the slightest. I\\ntell you I have never seen it in my life before!\"\\n\\nShe left the room as abruptly as she had entered, without even the\\ncivility of a good-bye; addressed a few hurried words in a low tone to\\nthe landlord in the hall, then, entering her conveyance, drove off into\\nthe rapidly gathering darkness.\\n\\n\"There\\'s something queer about her,\" said Martha, watching the departure\\nover the top of the short window blind. \"She was ready to take her oath\\nthat she\\'d never set eyes on the child before, but the sight of it sent\\nher crazy. Deny what she may, if you ask me, it\\'s my firm opinion she\\nwas telling a lie.\"\\n\\n\"Surely no one would refuse to acknowledge it!\" exclaimed Miss Barbara.\\n\"She seemed so terribly agitated and upset, she must have expected to\\nfind some other baby, and have been disappointed.\"\\n\\n\"Disappointed!\" sniffed Martha scornfully. \"Aye, she was disappointed at\\nfinding what she expected. Agitated and upset, no doubt, but the trouble\\nwas, she knew the poor bairn only too well.\"\\n\\nIn spite of the publicity given by the newspapers, no friends turned up\\nto claim the little girl. Nobody seemed to recognize her, or was able to\\nsupply the least clue to her parentage. It was impossible even to\\nascertain at what station the woman, presumably her mother, had joined\\nthe train. She was already settled in the corner when Miss Sherbourne\\nentered the compartment, and though a description of her was circulated,\\nnone of the porters remembered noticing her particularly. All the\\ncarriages had been full, and there had been several other women with\\nyoung children in the accident. Any luggage containing papers or\\narticles which might have led to her identification had been destroyed\\nin the fire. The baby\\'s clothing was unmarked. Day after day passed, and\\nthough many visits were paid and enquiries made, the result was\\ninvariably the same, and in a short time popular interest, always\\nfleeting and fickle, died completely away.\\n\\nAfter staying nearly a fortnight at the Red Lion Hotel, in the hope that\\nthe missing relatives might come at last to the scene of the disaster,\\nMiss Sherbourne returned to her own home, taking with her the child\\nwhich so strange a chance had given into her charge. For some months\\nshe still made an endeavour to establish its identity; she put\\nadvertisements in the newspapers and enlisted the services of the\\npolice, but all with no avail: and when a year had passed she realized\\nthat her efforts seemed useless. Her friends urged her strongly to send\\nthe little foundling to an orphanage, but by that time both she and\\nMartha had grown so fond of it that they could not bear the thought of a\\nparting.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll adopt her as my niece, if you\\'re willing to take your share of the\\ntrouble, Martha,\" said Miss Barbara.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t call it trouble,\" returned Martha. \"The bairn\\'s the very sunshine\\nof the house, and it would break my heart if she went.\"\\n\\n\"Very well; in future, she\\'s mine. I shall name her Dorothy Greenfield,\\nbecause Dorothy means \\'a gift of God\\', and it was at Greenfield that the\\naccident occurred. I feel that Fate flung her into my arms that day, and\\nsurely meant me to keep her. She was a direct \\'gift\\', so I accept the\\nresponsibility as a solemn charge.\"\\n\\nMiss Sherbourne\\'s decision met with considerable opposition from her\\nrelations.\\n\\n\"You\\'re quixotic and foolish, Barbara, to think of attempting such a\\nthing,\" urged her aunt. \"It\\'s absurd, at your age, to saddle yourself\\nwith a child to bring up. Why, you may wish to get married!\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" said Miss Barbara hastily, her thoughts on an old heartache\\nthat obstinately refused to accept decent burial; \"that will never\\nbe--now. You must not take that contingency into consideration at all.\"\\n\\n\"You may think differently in a year or two, and it would be cruelty to\\nthe child to bring her up as a lady and then hand her over to an\\ninstitution.\"\\n\\n\"I should not do her that injustice. I take her now, and promise to keep\\nher always.\"\\n\\n\"But with your small means you really cannot afford it.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure I shall be able to manage, and the child herself is\\nsufficient compensation for anything I must sacrifice; she\\'s a companion\\nalready.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t approve of it,\" said Aunt Lydia, with disfavour. \"If you\\nwant companionship, you can always have one of your nieces to stay a\\nweek or two with you.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not the same; they have their own homes and their own parents, and\\nare never anything but visitors at my house. However fond they may be of\\nme, I feel I am only a very secondary consideration in their lives. I\\ncan\\'t be content with such crumbs of affection. Little Dorothy seems\\nentirely mine, because she has nobody else in the world to love her.\"\\n\\n\"Then you actually intend to assume the full responsibility of her\\nmaintenance, and to educate her in your own station--a child sprung from\\nwho knows where?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. I shall regard her absolutely as my niece, and I shall\\nnever part with her unless someone should come and show a higher right\\nthan mine to claim her.\"\\n\\nHaving exhausted all their arguments, Miss Sherbourne\\'s relatives gave\\nher up in despair. She was old enough to assert her own will and manage\\nher own affairs, and if she liked to spend a large proportion of her\\nscanty income on bringing up a foundling,--well, she need not expect any\\nhelp from them in the matter. They ignored the child, and never asked it\\nto their houses, refusing to recognize that it had any claim to be\\ntreated on an equality with their own children, and disapproving from\\nfirst to last of the whole proceeding.\\n\\nIt was part of Miss Barbara\\'s plan to let little Dorothy grow up in\\ncomplete ignorance of her strange history. She did not wish her to\\nrealize that she was different from other children, or to allow any\\nslight to be cast upon her, or any unkind references made to her\\ndependent position. For this reason she removed into Yorkshire, and\\nsettled down at the village of Hurford, where the circumstances of the\\ncase were not known, and Dorothy could be received as her niece without\\nquestion. She left the little girl at home with Martha when she went to\\nstay with her relations, whom she succeeded in influencing so far that\\nshe persuaded them to refrain from all allusions to Dorothy\\'s parentage\\nwhen they paid return visits to Holly Cottage. Dorothy had often\\nwondered why Aunt Lydia and Aunt Constance treated her so stiffly, but,\\nlike most children, she divided the world into nice and nasty people,\\nand simply included them in the latter category, without an inkling of\\nthe real reason for their coldness. That she was never asked to their\\nhomes did not trouble her in the least; she would have regarded such a\\nvisit as a penance. Martha kept the secret rigidly. In her blunt,\\nuncompromising fashion she adored the child, and was glad to have her in\\nthe house. Though she did not spare scoldings, and enforced a rigorous\\ndiscipline concerning the kitchen regions, she looked after Dorothy\\'s\\nwelfare most faithfully, especially during Miss Sherbourne\\'s absence,\\nand always took the credit for having a half-share in her upbringing.\\n\\nAnd now more than thirteen years had passed away, and the chubby baby\\nhad grown into a tall girl who must be verging upon fourteen. Time,\\nwhich had brought a line or two to Miss Barbara\\'s face, and a chance\\ngrey thread among her brown locks, had also brought her a modest measure\\nof success. She had always possessed a taste for literary work, and in\\nthe quiet village of Hurford she had been able to write undisturbed. Her\\narticles, reviews, and short stories appeared in various magazines and\\npapers, and by this method of adding to her income she had been able to\\nsend Dorothy to Avondale College. It was quite an easy journey by train\\nfrom Hurford to Coleminster, and the school was considered one of the\\nbest in the north of England. The girl had been there for four years,\\nand had made satisfactory progress, though she had not shown a decided\\nbent for any special subject. What her future career might be, Fate had\\nyet to determine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nDorothy makes a Friend\\n\\n\\nDorothy set off for school on the morning after the election in a very\\nsober frame of mind. Aunt Barbara had made her acquainted with most of\\nthe facts mentioned in our last chapter, and she now thoroughly\\nunderstood her own position. To a girl of her proud temperament the news\\nhad indeed come as a great humiliation. Instead of bringing a copy of\\nher pedigree to convince Agnes Lowe that she was one of the Sherbournes\\nof Devonshire, she would now be obliged to ignore the subject. She did\\nnot expect it would be mentioned openly again, but there might be hints\\nor allusions, and the mere fact that the girls at school should know was\\nsufficiently mortifying.\\n\\n\"Agnes was perfectly right,\" she thought bitterly. \"I am a waif, a\\nnobody, with no relations, and no place of my own in the world. I\\nsuppose I am exactly what she called me--a charity child! I wonder how\\nshe heard the story? But it really does not matter who told her; the\\nsecret has leaked out somehow, and no doubt it will soon be bruited all\\nover the College. It was time I knew about it myself; but oh dear, how\\ndifferent I feel since yesterday!\"\\n\\nThus Dorothy mused, all unconscious that the shuttle of Fate was already\\nbusy casting fresh threads into the web of her life, and that the next\\nfew minutes would bring her a meeting with one whose fortunes were\\nclosely interwoven with her own, and whose future friendship would lead\\nto strange and most unexpected issues. The train had reached Latchworth,\\nwhere a number of passengers were waiting on the platform. The door of\\nDorothy\\'s compartment was flung open, and a girl of about her own age\\nentered, wearing the well-known Avondale ribbon and badge on her straw\\nhat. Dorothy remembered noticing her among the new members who had been\\nplaced yesterday in the Upper Fourth, though she had had no opportunity\\nof speaking to her, and had not even learnt her name. A pretty,\\nfair-haired lady was seeing her off, and turned to Dorothy with an air\\nof relief.\\n\\n\"You are going to the College?\" she asked pleasantly. \"Oh, I am so glad!\\nThen Alison will have somebody to travel with. Will you be good-natured,\\nand look after her a little at school? She knows nobody yet.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll do my best,\" murmured Dorothy.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE NEW GIRL]\\n\\n\"It will be a real kindness. It is rather an ordeal to be a complete\\nstranger among so many new schoolfellows. Birdie, you must be sure to\\ncome back with this girl, then I shall feel quite happy about you. You\\nhave your books and your umbrella? Well, good-bye, darling, until five\\no\\'clock.\"\\n\\nThe girl stood waving her hand through the window until the train was\\nout of the station, then she came and sat down in the seat next to\\nDorothy. She had a plump, rosy, smiling face, very blue eyes, and\\nstraight, fair hair. Her expression was decidedly friendly.\\n\\nDorothy was hardly in a genial frame of mind, but she felt bound to\\nenter into conversation.\\n\\n\"You\\'re in the Upper Fourth, aren\\'t you?\" she began, by way of breaking\\nthe ice.\\n\\n\"Yes, and so are you. Aren\\'t you Dorothy Greenfield, who was put up for\\nthe Lower School election?\"\\n\\n\"And lost it!\" exclaimed Dorothy ruefully. \"I don\\'t believe I\\'ll ever\\ncanvass again, whatever office is vacant. The thing wasn\\'t managed\\nfairly. You haven\\'t told me your name yet.\"\\n\\n\"Alison Clarke, though I\\'m called Birdie at home.\"\\n\\n\"Do you live at Latchworth?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, at Lindenlea.\"\\n\\n\"That pretty house on the hill? I always notice it from the train. Then\\nyou must have just come. It has been to let for two years.\"\\n\\n\"We removed a month ago. We used to live at Leamstead.\"\\n\\n\"How do you like the Coll.?\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t tell yet. I expect I shall like it better when I know the\\ngirls. I\\'m glad you go in by this train, because it\\'s much jollier to\\nhave somebody to travel backwards and forwards with. Mother took me\\nyesterday and brought me home, but of course she can\\'t do that every\\nday.\"\\n\\nDorothy marched into school that morning feeling rather self-conscious.\\nShe could not be sure whether her story had been circulated or not, but\\nshe did not wish it to be referred to, nor did she want to enter into\\nany explanations. She imagined that her classmates looked at her in\\nrather a pitying manner. The bare idea put her on the defensive. Her\\npride could not endure pity, even for losing the Wardenship, so she kept\\naloof and spoke to nobody. It was easy enough to do this, since Hope\\nLawson was the heroine of the hour, and the girls, finding Dorothy\\nrather cross and unsociable, left her to her own devices. At the\\nmid-morning interval she took a solitary walk round the playground, and\\nat one o\\'clock, instead of joining the rest of the day boarders in the\\ngymnasium, she lingered behind in the classroom.\\n\\n\"What\\'s wrong with Dorothy Greenfield?\" asked Ruth Harmon. \"She\\'s so\\ngrumpy, one can\\'t get a word out of her.\"\\n\\n\"Sulking because she missed the election, I suppose,\" said Val Barnett.\\n\\n\"That\\'s not like Dorothy. She flares up and gets into tantrums, but she\\ndoesn\\'t sulk.\"\\n\\n\"And she doesn\\'t generally bear a grudge about things,\" added Grace\\nRussell.\\n\\n\"I believe I can guess,\" said Mavie Morris. \"I heard yesterday that she\\nisn\\'t really Miss Sherbourne\\'s niece at all; she was adopted when she\\nwas a baby, and she doesn\\'t even know who her parents were.\"\\n\\n\"Well, she can\\'t help that.\"\\n\\n\"Of course she can\\'t; but you know Dorothy! She\\'s as proud as Lucifer,\\nand Agnes Lowe called her a waif and a nobody.\"\\n\\n\"Agnes Lowe wants shaking.\"\\n\\n\"Well, she didn\\'t mean Dorothy to overhear her. She\\'s very sorry about\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m more sorry for Dorothy. So that\\'s the reason she\\'s looking so glum!\\nIsn\\'t she coming to the meeting?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. She\\'s up in the classroom.\"\\n\\n\"Someone fetch her.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go,\" said Mavie. \"It\\'s a shame to let her stay out of everything.\\nShe\\'s as prickly as a hedgehog to-day, and will probably snap my head\\noff, but I don\\'t mind. She may have a temper, but she\\'s one of the\\njolliest girls in the Form, all the same.\"\\n\\n\"So she is. It\\'s fearfully hard on her if what Agnes Lowe says is really\\ntrue. I vote we try to be nice to her, to make up.\"\\n\\n\"Any girl who refers to it would be a cad.\"\\n\\n\"Well, look here! Let us try to get her made secretary of our\\n\\'Dramatic\\'.\"\\n\\n\"Right you are! I\\'ll propose her myself.\"\\n\\nMavie ran quickly upstairs to the classroom.\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t you coming, Dorothy? It\\'s the committee meeting of the\\n\\'Dramatic\\', you know. The others are all waiting; they sent me to fetch\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll get on just as well without me,\" growled Dorothy, with her head\\ninside her desk.\\n\\n\"Nonsense! Don\\'t be such a goose. I tell you, everybody\\'s waiting.\"\\n\\n\"Dorothy\\'s jealous of Hope,\" piped Annie Gray, who, as monitress, was\\nperforming her duty of cleaning the blackboard.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not! How can you say such a thing? I don\\'t care in the least about\\nthe Wardenship.\"\\n\\n\"Then come and show up at the meeting, just to let them see you\\'re not\\nsulking, at any rate,\" whispered Mavie. \"Do be quick! I can\\'t wait any\\nlonger.\"\\n\\nDorothy slammed her desk lid, but complied. Though she would rather have\\npreferred her own society that day, she did not wish her conduct to be\\nmisconstrued into jealousy or sulks.\\n\\n\"Go on, Mavie, and I\\'ll follow,\" she replied abruptly, but not\\nungraciously.\\n\\nAs she strolled downstairs she noticed Alison Clarke standing rather\\naimlessly on the landing, as if she did not quite know where to go or\\nwhat to do. Dorothy\\'s conscience gave her a prick. She had quite\\nforgotten Alison, who, as a new girl, must be feeling decidedly out of\\nthings at the College. She certainly might have employed the\\neleven-o\\'clock interval much more profitably in befriending the\\nnew-comer than in mooning round the playground by herself, brooding over\\nher own troubles. However, it was not too late to make up for the\\nomission.\\n\\n\"Hallo!\" she exclaimed. \"Not a very breezy occupation to stand reading\\nthe Sixth Form timetable, is it?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve nothing better to do,\" replied Alison, whose rosy face looked a\\ntrifle forlorn. \"I don\\'t know a soul here yet, or the ways of the\\nplace.\"\\n\\n\"You know me! Come along to the gym.; we\\'re going to have a committee\\nmeeting.\"\\n\\nAlison brightened visibly.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the meeting about?\" she asked, as she stepped briskly with\\nDorothy along the passage.\\n\\n\"It\\'s our \\'Dramatic\\'. You see, we who stay for dinner get up little\\nplays among ourselves. Each Form acts one or two every term. They\\'re\\nnothing grand--not like the swell things they have at the College\\nDramatic Union--and we only do them before the other girls in the gym.,\\nbut they\\'re great fun, all the same.\"\\n\\n\"I love acting!\" declared Alison, with unction.\\n\\n\"Ever done any?\"\\n\\n\"Rather! We were keen on it at the school I went to in Leamstead. I was\\n\\'Nerissa\\' once, and \\'Miss Matty\\' in _Scenes from Cranford_, and \\'The\\nMarch Hare\\' in _Alice in Wonderland_. I have the mask still, and the fur\\ncostume, and Miss Matty\\'s cap and curls.\"\\n\\n\"Any other properties?\"\\n\\n\"Heaps--in a box at home. There are Miss Matty\\'s mittens and cross-over,\\nand her silk dress.\"\\n\\n\"Good! I must tell the girls that. We requisition everything we can.\\nWhere are they having the meeting, I wonder? Oh, there\\'s Mavie beckoning\\nto us near the horizontal bar!\"\\n\\nThe day boarders belonging to the Upper Fourth were collected in a\\ncorner of the gymnasium, waiting impatiently for a few last arrivals.\\nThey made room for Dorothy and Alison, and as Annie Gray followed in a\\nmoment or two, the meeting began almost immediately. Hope Lawson, by\\nvirtue of her Wardenship, took the chair. The first business of the\\nsociety was to choose a secretary.\\n\\n\"I beg to propose Dorothy Greenfield,\" said Grace Russell, putting in\\nher word before anyone else had an opportunity, and looking at Ruth\\nHarmon.\\n\\n\"And I beg to second the proposal,\" said Ruth, rising to the occasion.\\n\\nNobody offered the slightest opposition, and Dorothy was elected\\nunanimously. Very much surprised, but extremely pleased, she accepted\\nthe notebook and stump of pencil that were handed her as signs of\\noffice.\\n\\n\"The next thing is to choose a play,\" said Hope, \"and I think we can\\'t\\ndo better than take one of these _Scenes from Thackeray_. _Miss\\nPinkerton\\'s Establishment for Young Ladies_ is lovely.\"\\n\\n\"Who\\'d be Miss Pinkerton?\"\\n\\n\"It depends on the costume. She ought to have curls, and a cap and\\nmittens, and a silk dress.\"\\n\\n\"Can we fish them up from anywhere?\"\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t you say you\\'d had them for Miss Matty?\" whispered Dorothy to\\nAlison; adding aloud: \"This new girl, Alison Clarke, has the complete\\ncostume at home, and she\\'s accustomed to acting. I say she\\'d better take\\nMiss Pinkerton.\"\\n\\n\"One can\\'t give the best part to a new girl,\" objected Annie Gray.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not the best part; it\\'s nothing to Becky Sharp.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s the second best, anyhow.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, never mind that! Let her try. If you find she can\\'t manage it, you\\ncan put in somebody else instead. Give her a chance to show what she can\\ndo, at any rate,\" pleaded Dorothy.\\n\\n\"We\\'d destined Miss Pinkerton for you,\" murmured Grace Russell.\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll resign in favour of Alison. Let me take Miss Swartz, or one\\nof the servants--I don\\'t mind which.\"\\n\\nIt was characteristic of Dorothy that, having reproached herself for\\nneglecting Alison, she was at once ready to renounce anything and\\neverything for her benefit. She never did things by halves, and,\\nconsidering that she had made a promise in the train, she meant to keep\\nit; moreover, she had really taken a fancy to the new-comer\\'s beaming\\nface.\\n\\n\"So be it!\" said Hope. \"Put it down provisionally--Miss Pinkerton,\\nAlison Clarke. Now the great business is to choose Becky. Oh, bother!\\nThere\\'s the dinner bell! It always rings at the wrong minute. No, we\\ncan\\'t meet again at two, because I have my music lesson. We must wait\\ntill to-morrow.\"\\n\\nDorothy escorted her protégée to the dining-room, and, when dinner was\\nover, spent the remaining time before school in showing her the library,\\nthe museum, and the other sights of the College.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t feel so absolutely at sea now?\" she enquired.\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m getting quite at home, thanks to you. It\\'s such a comfort to\\nhave somebody to talk to. Yesterday was detestable.\"\\n\\nAt three o\\'clock the Upper Fourth had a literature lesson with Miss\\nTempest. It was held in the lecture hall instead of their own classroom,\\nand just as the girls were filing in at the door, Dorothy made the\\nhorrible discovery that in place of her Longfellow she had brought an\\nEnglish history book. It was impossible to go back, for Miss Pitman was\\nstanding on the stairs.\\n\\n\"What am I to do?\" she gasped. \"How could I have been so idiotically\\nstupid?\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t you look on with somebody?\" suggested Alison, who was walking\\nwith her.\\n\\n\"Miss Tempest will notice, and ask the reason. She\\'s fearfully down on\\nus if we forget anything. I\\'m in the front row, too, worse luck!\"\\n\\n\"Then take my Longfellow and give me your History. Perhaps I shan\\'t be\\nasked to read. We\\'ll chance it, anyhow,\" said Alison, changing the two\\nbooks before Dorothy had time to object.\\n\\n\"No, no; it\\'s too bad!\" began Dorothy; but at that moment Miss Pitman\\ncalled out: \"What are you two girls waiting for? Move on at once!\" and\\nthey were obliged to pass into the lecture hall and go to their seats.\\n\\nFortune favoured them that afternoon. Miss Tempest, in the course of the\\nlesson, twice asked Dorothy to read passages, and completely missed out\\nAlison, who sat rejoicing tremulously in the back row.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t know from what you\\'ve saved me,\" said the former, as she\\nreturned the book when the class was over. \"I should have been utterly\\nundone without your Longfellow.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s like the fable of the mouse and the lion,\" laughed Alison. \"I must\\nsay I felt a little nervous when Miss Tempest looked in my direction. I\\nthought once she was just going to fix on me. All\\'s well that ends well,\\nthough.\"\\n\\n\"And I won\\'t be such a duffer again,\" declared Dorothy.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"Mother, dearest,\" said Alison Clarke that evening, \"I didn\\'t think the\\nCollege half so horrid to-day as I did yesterday. I like Dorothy\\nGreenfield, she\\'s such a jolly girl. She took me all round the place and\\nshowed me everything, and told me what I might do, and what I mustn\\'t.\\nWe went to the Dramatic meeting--at least, it wasn\\'t the real College\\nDramatic, but one in our own Form--and I got chosen for Miss Pinkerton.\\nDorothy\\'s going to be Miss Swartz, I expect. We\\'ve arranged to travel\\ntogether always. She\\'s going to wave her handkerchief out of the window\\nthe second the train gets to Latchworth, so that I can go into her\\ncarriage; and we shall wait for each other in the dressing-room after\\nschool.\"\\n\\n\"I thought she looked a nice girl,\" said Mrs. Clarke. \"She has such a\\nbright, intelligent face, and she answered so readily and pleasantly\\nwhen I spoke to her. I\\'m glad to hear she took you under her wing, and\\nshowed you the Avondale ways. You\\'ll soon feel at home there now,\\nBirdie.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I shall get along all right! Miss Tempest is rather tempestuous,\\nand Miss Pitman\\'s only tolerable, but the acting is going to be fun. As\\nfor Dorothy, she\\'s ripping!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nA Literature Exercise\\n\\n\\nThe fickle goddess of fortune, having elected to draw together the lives\\nof Dorothy Greenfield and Alison Clarke, had undoubtedly begun her task\\nby sending the latter to live near Coleminster. Mrs. Clarke told all her\\nfriends that it was by the merest chance she had seen and taken\\nLindenlea. She had decided that the climate of Leamstead was too\\nrelaxing; and when, on a motor tour with a cousin in the North, she\\nhappened to pass through the village of Latchworth, and noticed the\\npretty, rambling old house to let on the top of the hill, she had at\\nonce insisted upon stopping, obtaining the keys, and looking over it.\\nAnd she had so immediately and entirely fallen in love with its\\npleasant, sunny rooms and delightful garden that she had interviewed the\\nagent without further delay, and arranged to take it on a lease.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the very kind of place I\\'ve always longed for!\" she\\ndeclared--\"old-fashioned enough to be picturesque, yet with every modern\\ncomfort: a good coach-house and stable, a meadow large enough to keep a\\nJersey cow in, a splendid tennis court, and the best golf links in the\\nneighbourhood close by. Another advantage is that Alison can go to\\nAvondale College. The house is so near to the station that she can\\ntravel by train into Coleminster every day, and return at four o\\'clock.\\nI\\'m never able to make up my mind to spare her to go to a boarding\\nschool; but, on the other hand, I don\\'t approve of girls being taught at\\nhome by private governesses. The College exactly solves the problem. No\\none can say I\\'m not giving her a good education, and yet I shall see her\\nevery day, and have her all Saturday and Sunday with me. It\\'s no use\\npossessing a daughter unless she can be something of a companion, and I\\nalways think Nature meant a mother to bring up her own child,\\nparticularly when she\\'s a precious only chick like mine.\"\\n\\nAlison had no memory of her father, who had died in her infancy. Her\\nmother had been as both parents to her, and had supplied the place of\\nbrothers and sisters as well. Poor Mrs. Clarke could not help fussing\\nover her one treasure, and Alison\\'s education, amusements, clothes, and,\\nabove all, health, were her supreme interests in life. The girl was\\ninclined to be delicate; she had suffered as a child from bronchial\\nasthma, and though she had partly outgrown the tendency, an occasional\\nattack still alarmed her mother.\\n\\nIt was largely on Alison\\'s account that Mrs. Clarke had taken Lindenlea.\\nShe thought the open, breezy situation on the top of a hill likely to\\nsuit her far better than the house at Leamstead, which had been situated\\ntoo close to the river; and she knew that the neighbourhood of\\nColeminster was considered specially bracing for those troubled with\\nthroat or chest complaints. At fourteen Alison was one of those\\nover-coddled, petted, worshipped only daughters who occasionally, in\\ndefiance of all ordinary rules, seem to escape becoming pampered and\\nselfish. She had a very sweet and sensible disposition, and a strong\\nsense of justice. In her heart of hearts she hated to be spoilt or in\\nany way favoured. She would have liked to be one of a large family, and\\nshe greatly envied girls with younger brothers and sisters to care for.\\nDearly as she loved her mother, it was often a real trial to her to be\\nidolized in public. She was quick to catch the amused smile of visitors\\nwho listened while her praises were sung, and the everlasting subject of\\nher health was discussed; and to detect the disapproval with which they\\nnoticed her numerous indulgences. She felt it unfair that strangers, and\\neven friends, seemed to consider her selfish for receiving all the good\\nthings showered upon her. She could not disappoint her mother by\\nrefusing any of them, though she would gladly have handed them on to\\nsomeone less fortunate than herself. To her credit, she never once\\nallowed her mother to suspect that this over-fond and anxious affection\\nmade her appear singular, and occasionally even a subject of ridicule\\namong other girls. She submitted quite patiently to the cosseting and\\nworrying about her health, only sighing a little over the superfluous\\nwraps and needless tonics, and wishing, though never for less love,\\ncertainly for less close and fretting attention.\\n\\nPerhaps as the direct result of this adoration at home, Alison was a\\npleasant companion at school, quite ready to give up her own way on\\noccasion, and enjoying the sensation of sharing alike with everyone\\nelse. She was soon on good terms with her classmates, for she was merry\\nand humorous as well as accommodating. Her friendship with Dorothy\\nincreased daily. As they travelled backwards and forwards by train\\ntogether they were necessarily thrown much in each other\\'s company, and\\nthey earned the nicknames of \"David\" and \"Jonathan\" in the Form.\\n\\nThe contrast between the circumstances and the upbringing of the two\\ngirls could not, however, have been stronger. Miss Sherbourne, in\\nadopting Dorothy, had undertaken a charge that was a heavy if\\nself-imposed burden upon her small means. Rigid economy was the rule at\\nHolly Cottage; no luxuries could be afforded, and pleasures were mostly\\nof a kind that did not involve any great expenditure. It was rarely that\\nAunt Barbara indulged herself even to the extent of a concert ticket or\\na piece of new music. A fresh piano was out of the question, so she\\nmanaged to coax a good deal of melody from the old one. If it had not\\nbeen for the help of her writing she could not have sent Dorothy to the\\nCollege, and, as it was, such extras as dancing lessons were impossible.\\n\\nThough Dorothy clearly understood the necessity for economy, she often\\nsecretly chafed against it. She was a girl who liked to shine before her\\nschoolfellows, and she felt keenly that she lacked their advantages. It\\nwas hard, when all were talking of a play or an exhibition, to have to\\nconfess that she had not been, and to hear the others say pityingly:\\n\"Why, Dorothy, you never go anywhere!\" Her clothes, made by Aunt Barbara\\nat home, though beautifully neat and quite sufficient for a schoolgirl,\\ncould not compete with the pretty dresses worn by many of her\\ncompanions; and she did not possess even a watch, much less bangles and\\nchains such as Hope Lawson was fond of displaying.\\n\\nThe knowledge of her dependent position, which Aunt Barbara had so\\ncarefully kept hidden, came to her as the most serious of her drawbacks.\\nShe could not help brooding over it, and the more she dwelt upon the\\nsubject the more disconsolate and discontented she became. Aunt Barbara,\\nwhose loving eyes were quick to notice, saw only too clearly the phase\\nthrough which Dorothy was passing; but she knew that the girl must fight\\nher own battle before she learnt to set the right value on this world\\'s\\npossessions, and to discover for herself what things are really of\\nworth. With Dorothy\\'s character Miss Sherbourne often felt as though she\\nwere working in the dark. She did her best to impress her own\\npersonality upon the child, but every now and then some unexpected\\ntrait--a legacy, perhaps, from an unknown ancestor--would crop up and\\nmake her realize how strong is the force of heredity in our natures. She\\nrecognized that at the present crisis \"preaching\" would be useless, and\\ncould only trust that patience and forbearance would indirectly bring\\nabout the desired effect.\\n\\n\"Auntie,\" said Dorothy, as she ate her breakfast one morning, about a\\nmonth after the term began, \"I don\\'t like Hope Lawson since she got the\\nWardenship. She hasn\\'t improved.\"\\n\\n\"How\\'s that? I thought she was a tolerably nice girl,\" answered Miss\\nSherbourne.\\n\\n\"She wasn\\'t at all bad before, but she\\'s changed. She and Blanche Hall\\nand Irene Jackson go together now, and they simply sit upon all the rest\\nof the class.\"\\n\\n\"Rather a large order, if they do it literally!\" laughed Aunt Barbara.\\n\\n\"Metaphorically, of course. But really, Auntie, you\\'ve no idea how nasty\\nthey are. Hope has taken the tone that she\\'s much above everyone else--I\\ndon\\'t mean because she\\'s Warden, but socially. You see, while her father\\nhas been Mayor they\\'ve entertained numbers of distinguished people, and\\nHope\\'s never tired of talking about them. Then she comes to school\\nwearing heaps of bangles and rings and things, and she makes one feel\\nshe doesn\\'t consider one\\'s clothes anything to hers. She saw my blue\\nskirt had been lengthened, for she nudged Irene and laughed, and said\\nvery pointedly that braid had gone out of fashion. Then she asked me\\nwhere I bought my boots. I wasn\\'t going to tell her, so I didn\\'t answer;\\nbut Blanche Hall piped out: \\'The Market Stores\\', and they both screamed\\nwith laughter, and Hope said she always bought hers at Forster\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"I should simply take no notice, if I were you.\"\\n\\n\"I try not to, but all the same it\\'s annoying. Yesterday we had a\\nsquabble about giving out the French books, and I said I should ask Miss\\nPitman; then Hope said Miss Pitman would be sure to take her part,\\nbecause she often dines at their house. And the worst of it is, it\\'s\\ntrue. Miss Pitman isn\\'t quite fair. Hope and Blanche and Irene make the\\nmost tremendous fuss of her, and she always favours them--she does\\nreally. She gives them better marks for their exercises, and easier\\nquestions in class, and waits much longer for their answers than for\\nanybody else\\'s. She doesn\\'t like me.\"\\n\\n\"Dorothy!\"\\n\\n\"She doesn\\'t--honestly, Auntie. Even Alison notices how down she is on\\nme. If I do the least little thing I\\'m snapped up in a second.\"\\n\\n\"Then the obvious moral is, don\\'t do the least little thing.\"\\n\\nDorothy pulled a long face.\\n\\n\"Auntie! You were brought up by a private governess, and you don\\'t know\\nwhat it is to go to a huge school. One can\\'t always be absolutely\\nimmaculate; if one could, one would be a saint, not an ordinary girl. I\\ncan\\'t resist talking sometimes, or shuffling my feet, or fidgeting with\\nmy pencil, or--no, no; if you\\'re going to lecture, I shall fly! It\\'s ten\\npast eight, and it\\'s too wet to take the short cut across the field.\"\\n\\nDorothy certainly considered she had a grievance at present. She had\\nunfortunately not made a very good impression upon her new teacher. She\\ncould not bear to curry favour, and, seeing that Hope and some of the\\nothers were trying by every means in their power to pay special court to\\nMiss Pitman, she went to the opposite extreme, and became so abrupt as\\nto be almost uncivil in her manners.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not going to bring her flowers every morning, and offer her walnut\\ncreams in the interval,\" she thought. \"It seems like bribery, and I\\nshould think much better of her if she wouldn\\'t accept them. Miss Hardy\\nnever did.\"\\n\\nMiss Hardy, the mistress of the Lower Fourth, had been strict but\\nscrupulously just; she might be sometimes disliked by her pupils, but\\nshe was always respected. Miss Pitman was a totally different type of\\nteacher: she was younger, better looking, dressed more prettily, and\\ncared very much more for the social side of life. She lacked power to\\nenforce good discipline, and tried to supply her deficiency by making a\\nbid for popularity among her girls. She dearly loved the little\\nattentions they paid her: she liked to pin a rose on her dress, or carry\\nhome a bunch of hothouse flowers; she found tickets for concerts or\\nlectures most acceptable; and invitations--provided they were to nice\\nhouses--were not despised. Probably she had not the least idea that she\\nwas allowing her predilection for some of her pupils to bias her\\njudgment of their capacities in class, but in the few weeks that she had\\ntaught the Upper Fourth she had already gained a reputation for\\nfavouritism.\\n\\n\"She can be so particularly mean,\" said Dorothy, continuing the recital\\nof her grievances to Alison in the train. \"She deliberately helped\\nBlanche out with one question yesterday, and she wouldn\\'t give me even\\nthe least hint.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t like her myself,\" commented Alison, \"though she isn\\'t as hard\\non me as she is on you. But it\\'s perfectly easy to see what\\'s the matter\\nwith Miss Pitman--she\\'s ambitious to climb. She wouldn\\'t accept the\\nParkers\\' invitation (they only live in a semi-detached villa), and she\\'s\\nbeen twice to the Lawsons\\', who send her home in a motor. Well, she\\nwon\\'t be asked to our house.\"\\n\\n\"Nor to ours, though I don\\'t suppose she\\'d want to come. All the same,\\nit\\'s disgusting, and I\\'ve a very poor opinion of her.\"\\n\\nThat morning Miss Pitman took her classes without her ordinary adornment\\nin the way of a button-hole. Hope Lawson was absent, and the delicate\\nMaréchal Niel or dainty spray of carnations that usually lay on her desk\\nat nine o\\'clock was absent also. Perhaps she missed it, for she was both\\nimpatient and snappy in her manner during the lessons, waxed sarcastic\\nwhen Noëlle Kennedy demanded an explanation of a rather obvious point,\\nand made no allowance for slips. She dictated the History notes so\\nquickly that it was very difficult to follow her, and woe to Dorothy,\\nwho was rash enough to ask her to repeat a sentence!\\n\\n\"Are you deaf, Dorothy Greenfield? Sit up and don\\'t poke. I can\\'t allow\\nyou to stoop over your desk in that way. If you\\'re shortsighted, you\\nhad better go to an oculist and get fitted with glasses.\"\\n\\nDorothy was apt to poke, and her attitude when writing was most\\ninelegant; but it is difficult to remember physical culture during the\\nagonies of following a quick dictation. She frowned and looked\\nthunderous as she made a jerky effort to sit straight.\\n\\n\"Miss Pitman\\'s crosser than usual,\" she said to Alison at eleven\\no\\'clock. \"You\\'ll see, I shall only get \\'Moderate\\' for my literature\\nexercise, however well I do it.\"\\n\\n\"You mean she\\'ll mark it low on purpose?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; she never judges me fairly.\"\\n\\n\"But does she look at the names on the labels when she\\'s correcting?\"\\n\\n\"You may be sure she does, or Hope wouldn\\'t always have \\'Very Good\\'.\"\\n\\n\"Then, just as an experiment, let us exchange. I\\'ll write my exercise in\\nyour book, and you can write yours in mine. Our writing\\'s sufficiently\\nalike.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that would be a gorgeous joke! We\\'ll do it; but don\\'t tell a soul.\\nLet us go upstairs and arrange it now.\"\\n\\nDorothy wrote her literature exercise that morning in the book labelled\\n\"Alison Clarke\". She had prepared her subject carefully, and did her\\nvery best not only to put down correct facts, but to attend to points\\nof composition. She tried to avoid tautology, unduly long sentences, and\\nvarious other mistakes to which she was prone, and flattered herself at\\nthe end of the half-hour that she had turned out a decidedly creditable\\npiece of work. She blotted it with great satisfaction, and by rather\\nofficiously collecting the books of several girls who sat near, and\\nplacing hers in the middle of the pile, she managed to hand it to the\\nmonitress without showing the incriminating \"Alison Clarke\" on the\\ncover. There was a singing class from 12 to 12.45, during which time\\nMiss Pitman always did her corrections. When the girls rushed up to the\\nclassroom at a quarter to one, the books were finished and placed ready\\nupon the table. Alison and Dorothy each seized her own, and retired\\ntogether to a corner of the room.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got \\'Fair\\' in my book,\" whispered Dorothy. \"Now let me see what\\nI\\'ve got in yours.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Excellent\\'!\"\\n\\n\"Fiddlesticks!\"\\n\\n\"Well, look for yourself.\"\\n\\n\"It actually is! Oh! Miss Pitman would never have given me \\'Excellent\\'\\nif she\\'d known it was mine. I feel I\\'ve scored no end. Doesn\\'t it show\\nher up?\"\\n\\n\"Rather!\"\\n\\n\"Excellent\" was the very highest mark possible, and it was rarely given\\nat the College. To receive it was certainly a great honour, and showed\\nthe merit of the exercise. The two conspirators thought they had been\\nextremely clever, and congratulated themselves upon the success of their\\nlittle plot; but it was to have a sequel which neither of them expected\\nin the least. Miss Tempest taught literature throughout the school, and\\nthough she delegated the correction of exercises to assistant\\nmistresses, she occasionally made some enquiry about the written portion\\nof the work. That afternoon she entered the Upper Fourth classroom.\\n\\n\"I wish to know the results of your literature exercises,\" she\\nannounced. \"I myself set the paper this week, and I want to see what\\nstandard you have reached individually. Will each girl in turn repeat\\nher mark, beginning with Noëlle Kennedy?\"\\n\\nDorothy was in a quandary: she did not know what she ought to say. Must\\nshe give the mark that was written in her book, or the one she had\\nreally gained? Justice seemed to point to the latter, so when it came to\\nher turn she answered \"Excellent\". Alison, taking the cue from her,\\nanswered \"Fair\". Evidently the exercises had not reached a very high\\nstandard of merit that day. There were a few \"Goods\", a great many\\n\"Moderates\" and \"Fairs\", and even one or two \"Weaks\" and \"Faulties\". At\\nthe end of the recital the head mistress was just about to give her\\ncomment, when Miss Pitman intervened.\\n\\n\"May I say a word, Miss Tempest? One girl has not stated her mark\\ncorrectly. Dorothy Greenfield said \\'Excellent\\'. Now I particularly\\nremember that I only gave one \\'Excellent\\' this morning, and that was not\\nto Dorothy.\"\\n\\nMiss Tempest turned to Dorothy with her sternest look.\\n\\n\"Repeat your mark!\" she ordered.\\n\\n\"Excellent,\" quavered Dorothy, sticking to her point, though she foresaw\\na storm.\\n\\n\"Hand me your exercise!\"\\n\\nDorothy fumbled in her desk with trembling fingers. She knew she was\\ninvolved in a most awkward situation. She was very pale as she passed up\\nthe book. Miss Tempest opened it and glared first at the \"Fair\", written\\nplainly in Miss Pitman\\'s handwriting, and then at the embarrassed face\\nof her pupil.\\n\\n\"I should not have thought you would consider it worth while to attempt\\nto deceive me with so palpable a falsehood, Dorothy Greenfield!\" she\\nsaid scornfully.\\n\\nDorothy turned all colours. For once her wits deserted her. She could\\nnot imagine how to explain the matter. The whole thing had happened so\\nsuddenly that there seemed no time to cudgel up a word in self-defence.\\nA groan of indignation passed round the class, which Miss Tempest\\ninstantly suppressed.\\n\\n\"Well, what have you to say for yourself, Dorothy? Do you consider such\\nconduct worthy of a girl who was nominated for the Wardenship?\"\\n\\n\"Please, Miss Tempest, may I speak?\" said a voice at the back; and\\nAlison Clarke stood up, blushing scarlet, but determined to have her\\nsay.\\n\\n\"Do you know anything about this, Alison?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; it\\'s my fault. We changed exercise books. The one in Dorothy\\'s\\nbook marked \\'Fair\\' is really mine, and here is Dorothy\\'s, marked\\n\\'Excellent\\', in my book. If you\\'ll please look at it you\\'ll see it\\'s her\\nown writing--she makes Greek e\\'s, and I never do.\"\\n\\nMiss Tempest frowned, but she nevertheless examined the exercise, which\\na row of eager hands passed up to her.\\n\\n\"Is this Dorothy Greenfield\\'s writing, Miss Pitman?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"It certainly has all the characteristics,\" admitted the Form mistress.\\n\\n\"Why were you writing in each other\\'s book?\" enquired Miss Tempest\\nsharply.\\n\\nAlison\\'s scarlet face took an even deeper shade of crimson.\\n\\n\"Oh--just silliness!\" she murmured. \"But it seemed more honest each to\\ntake the mark we\\'d really gained. I couldn\\'t give in \\'Excellent\\' when\\nI\\'d only had \\'Fair\\'.\"\\n\\n\"Take care such a thing never happens again,\" said Miss Tempest, eyeing\\nboth the culprits, who at that moment would have given a great deal to\\nhave been a little less clever. \"You will each put down \\'Fair\\' in your\\nreports.\"\\n\\n\"So I\\'ve lost my \\'Excellent\\',\" lamented Dorothy after school. \"Miss\\nPitman will be rejoicing; I believe she \\'twigged\\'.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m almost certain she did, she was looking at you so keenly. Well,\\nthere\\'s one good thing, it will show her that we think she favours.\"\\n\\n\"Much she\\'ll care!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know! No teacher likes to be accused of unfairness.\"\\n\\n\"I know one thing--I should have got into an uncommonly big scrape if\\nyou hadn\\'t put in a word.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it was much easier for me than for you, as you\\'d got the\\n\\'Excellent\\'.\"\\n\\n\"But I haven\\'t got it now, worse luck! And probably I shan\\'t have\\nanother all this term,\" groaned Dorothy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nA Promise\\n\\n\\nDorothy had grown so accustomed to travelling to school with Alison that\\nshe felt extremely at a loss when one morning she looked out of the\\ncarriage window at Latchworth and did not see the familiar rosy, smiling\\nface on the platform.\\n\\n\"I wonder if Alison\\'s late, or if she\\'s stopping at home?\" she thought.\\n\"She had rather a cold yesterday, and Mrs. Clarke seems so fearfully\\nfussy. I\\'m glad Aunt Barbara doesn\\'t worry over me to such an extent; it\\nmust be a perfect nuisance to have to wear galoshes just on the chance\\nof its raining, and to swathe a Shetland shawl over your mouth if\\nthere\\'s the slightest atom of damp in the air. And Alison is so\\nconscientious over it! I believe I should stuff the shawl inside my\\nsatchel, and lose the galoshes on purpose!\"\\n\\nThe journey seemed dull without her friend and their usual chat\\ntogether. It was not interesting to stare out of the window when she\\nknew every yard of the line by heart, and for lack of other occupation\\nshe was reduced to taking out her books and looking over her lessons.\\nBoth in the mid-morning interval and the half-hour before dinner she\\nmissed Alison exceedingly. She tried to fill up the time with various\\nexpedients. She got a book from the library, and was so long and so\\nfastidious in choosing that the prefect in charge grew tired of\\nrecommending, and waxed impatient.\\n\\n\"Really, Dorothy Greenfield, you might be a literary critic! One is too\\nchildish, and another\\'s too stiff, and you don\\'t care for historical\\ntales. I should like to know what you do want! Be quick and take\\nsomething, or I shall just lock the case up again and leave you without\\nanything. Oh, you\\'d like _The Old Curiosity Shop_! Then why couldn\\'t you\\nsay so at first?\"\\n\\nThough Dorothy had settled on a Dickens for the sake of making some\\nchoice, she had no intention of reading just at present, and she\\nsauntered into the gymnasium to see what the others were doing. It was\\nnot the day for a dramatic rehearsal, and nothing particular was going\\non. Some of the girls were playing rounders, but most were standing\\nabout chatting, and waiting for the dinner bell. Hope Lawson and Blanche\\nHall were talking together, and as Dorothy passed she caught a fragment\\nof their conversation.\\n\\n\"We shall have to fly, the second dinner is over,\" said Hope; \"but I\\nbelieve we shall just be able to do it.\"\\n\\n\"If we only get a peep at the dresses as they go in, it will be worth\\nit,\" replied Blanche. \"I hear there are to be twelve bridesmaids and two\\npages. We\\'ll do a bolt!\"\\n\\n\"What are Hope and Blanche talking about?\" said Dorothy to Addie Parker,\\nwho was standing close by.\\n\\n\"Why, there\\'s a grand wedding at St. Peter\\'s at two o\\'clock. Miss\\nRussell is to be married, and I suppose it will be ever such a swell\\naffair. They were laying down red carpets when I passed this morning. I\\npeeped into the church, and some men were just bringing pots of the\\nloveliest flowers.\"\\n\\n\"Are Hope and Blanche going to see it, then?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, no doubt. Bertha Warren and I mean to go, and so do Annie Gray and\\nJoyce Hickson. I wouldn\\'t miss it for the world. You\\'d better come.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll think about it,\" returned Dorothy.\\n\\nThe more she considered the idea the more she liked it, in spite of the\\nfact that it was a rather doubtful adventure. There was no exact rule\\nthat the girls should not leave the College during the dinner hour, but\\nit was well understood, all the same, that they remained on the\\npremises.\\n\\n\"Miss Tempest has never said so,\" thought Dorothy, \"nor have any of the\\nmistresses. When a thing hasn\\'t been forbidden, I suppose it\\'s allowed.\\nSt. Peter\\'s is just round the corner, so I declare I\\'ll go. I\\'ve never\\nseen a smart wedding.\"\\n\\nAs soon as dinner was over she fled to the dressing-room to put on her\\noutdoor clothes, then, as Blanche described it, she \"did a bolt\". She\\nmuch preferred going by herself to joining Addie Parker and Bertha\\nWarren, so she scurried along, hoping they would not overtake her. At\\nthe lich-gate of the church she came upon Hope Lawson and Blanche Hall.\\n\\n\"Hallo, Dorothy! So you\\'ve sneaked away too?\" said Hope.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t call it sneaking,\" returned Dorothy. \"Why shouldn\\'t we come?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, why shouldn\\'t we, indeed?\" echoed Blanche.\\n\\n\"No reason at all, my dear,\" observed Hope, \"except that Miss Tempest\\nmight happen to make a bother about it if she heard. One never knows\\nquite what she\\'ll take it into her head to say or do.\"\\n\\n\"Then she mustn\\'t hear.\"\\n\\n\"Right you are! We certainly won\\'t tell of each other.\"\\n\\n\"Rather not!\"\\n\\n\"Will you promise too, Dorothy, never to breathe one single word that\\nyou\\'ve seen Blanche and me here?\"\\n\\n\"Of course! Do you think I\\'m likely to go telling tales to Miss\\nTempest?\"\\n\\n\"Well, no; but you\\'ll promise not to tell any body, not even the girls?\"\\n\\n\"All serene!\"\\n\\n\"On your honour?\" said Hope, catching her by the arm.\\n\\n\"On my anything you like,\" answered Dorothy, who, seeing Bertha Warren\\nand Addie Parker coming up, was in a hurry to get away.\\n\\nShe was anxious to try to obtain a place in the church, so that she\\nmight see something of the ceremony. All the seats seemed taken as she\\nentered, but she marched confidently up the aisle, hoping to find room\\nfarther on. She was stopped directly, however, by the verger.\\n\\n\"What name, please? Are you one of the Miss Guntons?\" he enquired.\\n\\n\"No,\" stammered Dorothy, \"I--only----\"\\n\\n\"Then you must go out,\" he interrupted tartly. \"These pews is for the\\ninvited guests--general public\\'s only allowed in the free seats, and\\nthey\\'re full up long ago.\"\\n\\nMuch abashed, Dorothy beat a hasty retreat, after having caught a brief\\nvision of elegantly-dressed guests and beautiful rows of palms and\\nchrysanthemums in pots. Evidently there was no room for schoolgirls. She\\nwas annoyed with herself for having ventured there. Her pride hated\\nrebuffs, and the old verger\\'s manner made her feel hot and\\nuncomfortable. Several people in the pews had turned to look at her. No\\ndoubt they considered her an impertinent intruder. Her cheeks flamed at\\nthe idea. The churchyard seemed almost as full as the church, though the\\ncrowd there was of a totally different description. The possibility of\\nwitnessing the wedding had attracted a motley assemblage--nurses with\\nbabies and small children, errand boys, hatless women from back streets,\\ndressmakers\\' assistants who had come to see the fashions, and a number\\nof those idlers who are always to be found ready to run and look at\\nanything in the way of a show, be it a marriage, a funeral, or an\\naccident.\\n\\nBy a little judicious elbowing, Dorothy managed to secure a place where\\nshe had a tolerable view of the path and the lich-gate. She was wedged\\nrather tightly between two nursemaids, and the basket of a grocer\\'s boy\\nbehind was pressing into her back; but these were minor discomforts,\\nwhich must be endured.\\n\\n\"Here they come!\" said somebody.\\n\\nThere was a rustling and swaying movement among the crowd, a sound of\\ncarriage wheels, a general craning forward of heads; the nurse next to\\nDorothy held up her little charge in her arms. It was difficult to see,\\nfor the awning rather hid the view from those in the churchyard above\\nthe path. All that Dorothy caught was a glimpse of a figure in white\\nsatin and lace, and just a peep of some bridesmaids in palest blue; then\\na tall woman moved in front of her, and effectually shut out the\\nprospect.\\n\\n\"What a swindle!\" she thought. \"I\\'ve hardly seen anything at all. It\\nwasn\\'t worth the trouble of coming. I wonder if the other girls have had\\nbetter luck?\"\\n\\nShe noticed two school hats in the distance, though she could not\\nrecognize the faces under them. She was half inclined to struggle\\nthrough the groups of people towards them, when she remembered to look\\nat the church clock.\\n\\n\"Nearly twenty-five past!\" she ejaculated. \"I must fly!\"\\n\\nIt was not an easy matter to extricate herself from the crowd. Dorothy\\nknew it was useless to attempt to go out by the main entrance, so she\\nmade a push for the side gate; then taking a short cut by a small\\nstreet, she scurried back to school. She was just changing her boots in\\nthe dressing-room when Addie Parker, Bertha Warren, and three other\\ngirls came hurrying in.\\n\\n\"Oh, Dorothy! Did you get off?\" cried Addie. \"You are lucky! We were all\\ncaught!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, caught dead--every one of us!\" echoed Bertha.\\n\\n\"Oh, it was horrible!\" exclaimed Joyce Hickson. \"I never expected she\\'d\\nbe there.\"\\n\\n\"And we ran almost plump against her!\"\\n\\n\"Just our luck!\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean? Who caught you?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\\n\"Miss Tempest. Didn\\'t you see her?\"\\n\\n\"No, not I.\"\\n\\n\"Then thank your good star!\"\\n\\n\"Where was she?\"\\n\\n\"Close to the lich-gate. She came up quite suddenly, just when the bride\\nhad gone in. Phyllis saw her first, and passed on a \\'Cave\\', but it was\\nimpossible to get away, there were so many people round.\"\\n\\n\"She must have noticed our school hats in the distance,\" added Annie\\nGray.\\n\\n\"What did she do?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\\n\"Pulled out her notebook and took all our names. Oh, I\\'m just shaking in\\nmy shoes! I didn\\'t know whether I dared come back to school, or whether\\nI hadn\\'t better trek straight off home.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'d have got into a worse pickle still if you\\'d done that.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I should. Anyhow, I\\'m quaking.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it\\'s \\'Look out for squalls\\'!\"\\n\\n\"Squalls? A tempest, you mean!\"\\n\\n\"It will be a raging Tempest, certainly.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, goody! There\\'s the bell, and I haven\\'t changed my boots!\"\\n\\n\"Did you see anything, though?\" asked Dorothy, as they hurried\\nupstairs.\\n\\n\"Yes, I had a lovely view. The bridesmaids were sweet; their bouquets\\nwere all of lilies of the valley: and as for Miss Russell--it makes me\\nwant to be married myself! It was almost worth while being caught to see\\nit--but oh, dear! what will happen to us, I wonder? I\\'d give everything\\nI possess to have this afternoon over.\"\\n\\nFull of uneasy forebodings, the delinquents took their places at their\\ndesks. Dorothy looked round for Hope and Blanche. They slipped in at the\\nlast moment, rather red and out of breath, and seemingly anxious to\\navoid the enquiring eyes of the others.\\n\\nMiss Carter, the science mistress, entered, and the hygiene lesson\\nbegan. Eight guilty souls in the class found it difficult to fix their\\nattention upon ventilation or food values. Dorothy\\'s mind was in a\\nferment. What was about to happen? She had not thought it any great\\ncrime to go to see the wedding, but apparently such an action was viewed\\nfar more seriously at head-quarters. In her speculation on the issue of\\nevents, she gave such random answers that Miss Carter stared at her in\\nsurprise.\\n\\n\"Did you misunderstand the question, or are you not attending, Dorothy\\nGreenfield?\" she asked.\\n\\nDorothy made an effort to pull herself together and recall the forgotten\\nfacts, but they were elusive, and she could only stare stupidly at the\\nteacher. Just at that moment the door opened, and Miss Tempest entered.\\nThere was a perceptible shudder amongst those girls whose consciences\\ntold them they were to blame. Addie Parker and Bertha Warren exchanged\\nglances, Joyce Hickson pretended to be absorbed in her notebook, while\\nHope Lawson sat with her nose in the air, as if unconscious of any need\\nto disturb herself.\\n\\n\"Excuse me for interrupting the lesson, Miss Carter,\" began Miss\\nTempest, \"but there is a very important matter upon which I must speak\\nat once. Adeline Parker, Bertha Warren, Joyce Hickson, Annie Gray, and\\nPhyllis Fowler--stand up!\"\\n\\nWith downcast eyes the five girls responded to the command.\\n\\n\"I wish to know what you were doing at St. Peter\\'s Church this\\nafternoon?\"\\n\\nNo one had the courage to venture a reply.\\n\\n\"Who gave you permission to leave the school?\"\\n\\nStill there was dead silence among the culprits.\\n\\n\"You know perfectly well the day boarders are not allowed to go out\\nduring the dinner hour.\"\\n\\nMiss Tempest\\'s voice, which had begun icily, was waxing more stern and\\nwrathful. Addie Parker began to sob.\\n\\n\"How is it that among all the girls at the College you five had the\\npresumption to attempt such a flagrant breach of the rules? I say you\\nfive, for I saw you and took your names; but I certainly noticed another\\nAvondale hat among the crowd, and I intend to find out to whom it\\nbelonged. Was any other girl in this class present at St. Peter\\'s this\\nafternoon?\"\\n\\nDorothy\\'s conscience gave a great, uncomfortable prick. She had many\\nfaults, but concealment was not one of them, so she stood up.\\n\\n\"I was there, Miss Tempest,\" she said, rather defiantly.\\n\\nAt the head mistress\\'s gaze Dorothy dropped her eyes. Miss Tempest was\\nnot to be trifled with.\\n\\n\"Indeed! By whose permission?\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t ask anybody. I didn\\'t know the dinner girls weren\\'t allowed to\\ngo out. We none of us knew. We thought we had a perfect right to go.\"\\n\\n\"That cannot be true. You have been four years at the College, and no\\none is better acquainted with the rules than yourself. It is an\\nunheard-of thing for day boarders to leave until four o\\'clock, and could\\nnot be allowed for an instant. I am astonished that you should commit\\nsuch a breach of discipline and then attempt to justify yourself--yes,\\nastonished and disappointed in the extreme.\"\\n\\n\"But I really didn\\'t----\" began Dorothy.\\n\\n\"That will do,\" interrupted Miss Tempest sharply. \"I don\\'t wish to hear\\nany further excuses. You have shown me that you are not to be trusted.\"\\n\\n\"But I do speak the truth!\" burst out Dorothy.\\n\\n\"Dorothy Greenfield, if you answer me back again, I shall have to\\nrequest you to leave the College altogether. I do not allow any girl to\\nset her opinion against mine.\"\\n\\nWhen Miss Tempest was angry, her mouth looked grim and her eyes blazed.\\nQuite cowed, Dorothy did not venture to seek further to exculpate\\nherself. She stood twisting her hands nervously, and (I regret to say)\\nwith a very stubborn expression on her face. Inwardly she was raging.\\nThe head mistress glared at her for a moment, then turned to the class\\nagain.\\n\\n\"Was any other girl in this room at St. Peter\\'s this afternoon?\" she\\nasked. \"I appeal to your honour.\"\\n\\nNobody answered. Hope and Blanche sat still, with eyes that dared not\\nraise themselves to meet those of the mistress.\\n\\n\"Very well; I am glad to find no others have broken the rule. For the\\nrest of the term the six girls who so forgot themselves will not be\\nallowed in the gymnasium between one and half-past two. If it is too wet\\nto go into the playground, they must stay in the classrooms. Any of the\\nsix who enters the gymnasium during the prohibited time must report\\nherself to me at once in the library. Thank you, Miss Carter. I am sorry\\nto have been obliged to disturb your lesson, though more sorry still for\\nthe cause of the interruption.\"\\n\\nDorothy took in very little of the remainder of the hygiene lesson. She\\nwas in a ferment of indignation. Miss Tempest had doubted her word\\nbefore all the Form, and that rankled more than the scolding. Her\\ncontempt for Hope and Blanche was supreme, but she was angry, all the\\nsame, at their meanness. She was far too proud to cry like Addie Parker,\\nwhose eyes were already red and swollen, and whose cheeks were blotched\\nwith tears. She sat, a sullen, defiant little figure, nursing her wrath\\nand full of a burning sense of injustice.\\n\\nFortunately, the rest of the afternoon was devoted to drawing, and she\\nwas able to give a mechanical attention to her copy, which made her work\\njust pass muster.\\n\\n\"Not so good as usual to-day, Dorothy,\" said the art mistress at the\\nclose of the class. \"I can only give you \\'Fair\\'. I don\\'t think you have\\ntried your best.\"\\n\\nDorothy shut her pencil box with a slam. She was in a thoroughly bad\\ntemper, and felt that she did not much care what happened. Miss Giles\\ngave her a warning look, as if she were disposed to tell her to lose an\\norder mark; but seeing perhaps that the girl was overwrought and unlike\\nherself, she took no further notice, and passed on to the next drawing\\nboard.\\n\\nAs Dorothy left the studio, Hope Lawson managed to edge close up to her,\\nand whispered in her ear: \"Remember your promise! You said you wouldn\\'t\\ntell a soul--not even one of the girls.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t deserve it,\" mumbled Dorothy.\\n\\n\"But you promised on your honour--if you have any honour. Perhaps you\\nhaven\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve more than you,\" retorted Dorothy. \"You and Blanche are a couple of\\nsneaks. There! you needn\\'t look so aghast. I\\'m not going to blab. I\\'ve\\nenough self-respect to keep a promise when I\\'ve once made it, though, as\\nI said before, you don\\'t deserve it. You the Warden, too! A nice example\\nyou are to the Lower School, if they only knew it!\"\\n\\n\"They mustn\\'t know it. Promise me again, Dorothy; promise me faithfully\\nyou won\\'t tell. I\\'ll bring you a huge box of chocolates if you\\'ll keep\\nthis a secret.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want your chocolates!\" said Dorothy scornfully. \"I\\'ve told you\\nalready that I don\\'t break my promises. You\\'re safe enough as regards\\nme.\"\\n\\n\"Silence!\" called the mistress; and the two girls fell into line again\\nas they marched with their drawing boards down the corridor.\\n\\nIn the dressing-room the rest of the Form had plenty to say about the\\noccurrence.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve done for yourself, Dorothy,\" declared Ruth Harmon. \"You\\'ll be in\\nMiss Tempest\\'s bad books for evermore.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t see that I was any worse than the others,\" snapped Dorothy;\\n\"not so bad, indeed, because I wasn\\'t caught, and yet I owned up. Miss\\nTempest might have taken that into account.\"\\n\\n\"She would have, I dare say, if you hadn\\'t answered her back,\" said\\nNoëlle Kennedy.\\n\\n\"I only told her I didn\\'t know we mightn\\'t go.\"\\n\\n\"But you said it so cheekily, and Miss Tempest hates cheek above\\neverything. I shouldn\\'t care to be in your shoes now. What a good thing\\nyou weren\\'t chosen Warden!\"\\n\\nDorothy tugged at her boot lace till it snapped, then had to tie the two\\nends together in a knot. How hard it was to keep her unwelcome secret!\\nShe felt as if in common justice the girls ought to be made aware of the\\nmoral cowardice of their leader.\\n\\n\"I\\'d have made a better one than some--yourself not excepted,\" she\\ngrowled.\\n\\n\"My lady\\'s in her tantrums to-day,\" chirped Ruth.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not! What a hateful set you all are! I wish to goodness you\\'d leave\\nme alone!\"\\n\\nDorothy seized her books and stalked away without a good-bye to anybody.\\nHow thankful she was that Avondale was a day school, and that she could\\nshake the dust of it from her feet until nine o\\'clock to-morrow morning!\\n\\n\"If I weren\\'t going home to Aunt Barbara now, I should run away,\" she\\nthought. \"It would be dreadful to have to endure this all the evening.\\nOh dear, I hate the place, and I hate Miss Tempest, and I hate the\\ngirls, and everything, and everybody!\"\\n\\nPoor Dorothy carried a very sore heart back to Holly Cottage that\\nevening, but she cheered up when she entered the pretty little\\nsitting-room, with its bright fire and a cosy tea laid ready on the oak\\ntable. After the storms and whirlwinds of school, home seemed such a\\nhaven of refuge, and Aunt Barbara--who always understood--so utterly\\ndifferent a personality from Miss Tempest.\\n\\n\"I\\'m cross and horrid and disagreeable and altogether fractious,\\nAuntie!\" she said, squatting on the hearthrug after tea, with one of the\\ndear hands squeezed in hers, while she poured out her accumulation of\\ntroubles. \"I\\'ve got to keep that promise, but I can\\'t do it with any\\ngood grace, and I still feel that Miss Tempest was unjust, because\\nnobody had ever said we mightn\\'t leave the Coll. in dinner-time. And I\\'m\\nbarred the gym. It\\'s too disgusting, because it puts me out of all\\nrehearsals, and I shall have to give up my part in the act.\"\\n\\n\"Poor old sweetheart, you\\'ve certainly been in the wars to-day! But\\nhonestly, don\\'t you think it is just the least little scrap your own\\nfault? I fancy at the bottom you knew that dinner girls aren\\'t expected\\nto run out into the town whenever they like, even to look at\\nweddings--and it wasn\\'t justifiable to speak rudely to Miss Tempest, was\\nit?\"\\n\\nDorothy stared hard at the fire.\\n\\n\"No; I suppose I was cheeky. Auntie, when I\\'m at school and things are\\nhorrid, I just flare up and explode--I can\\'t help it. I\\'m quite\\ndifferent at home. I wish I had lessons with you again, like I did when\\nI was a little girl. I\\'d be far nicer.\"\\n\\n\"A soldier isn\\'t good for very much until he\\'s tried, is he? School is\\nyour battlefield at present, and the temper is the enemy. Won\\'t you be a\\nRed Cross Knight, and ride out to do full and fair fight with it? It\\'s\\nas ugly a dragon as ever attacked St. George.\"\\n\\n\"And a great deal harder to conquer, because every time I kill it, it\\ncomes to life again, ready for another go at me. There, Auntie! yes,\\nI\\'ll make a try; but I know I shall do lots more hateful things--I\\nalways do!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nAlison\\'s Home\\n\\n\\nDorothy was ready enough at making good resolutions--the difficulty\\nalways lay in keeping them when they were made. At night in bed it would\\nseem fairly simple to practise patience, forbearance, charity, humility,\\nand many kindred virtues, yet the very next morning she would come down\\nto breakfast with a frown that caused Aunt Barbara to sigh. Full of high\\nideals, she would dream over stories of courage and fortitude till she\\ncould believe herself ready to accomplish the most superhuman tasks and\\novercome innumerable difficulties. She always hoped that when she was\\ngrown up she might have a chance of emulating some of her book heroines,\\nand doing a golden deed which the world should remember. In the meantime\\nmany little ordinary, commonplace, everyday duties were left undone. She\\nwas not thoughtful for others, and was content to let Aunt Barbara do\\neverything for her, without troubling herself to consider what she might\\noffer in return.\\n\\nMiss Sherbourne was not blind, and saw only too clearly that the girl\\nwas passing through a selfish phase.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve seen it often enough in others of her age,\" she thought. \"They are\\nso sweet while they are little children, and then suddenly they lose all\\ntheir pretty, childish ways, and become brusque and pert and\\nuncompromising. I suppose they are struggling after their own\\nindividualities and independence, but it makes them ruthless to others.\\nAt present Dorothy is rather inclined to rebel against authority, and to\\nassert herself in many directions. She needs most careful leading and\\nmanagement. She\\'s affectionate, at any rate, and that\\'s something to go\\nupon.\"\\n\\nAunt Barbara could not guess all the trouble that was in Dorothy\\'s mind.\\nThough the latter had never referred again to the story of her adoption,\\nthe fact that she was a foundling continually rankled. She was so\\nsensitive on the point that she imagined many allusions or slights which\\nwere not intended. It was extremely silly, but when the girls at school\\ntalked about their brothers and sisters, she often believed they did so\\npurposely to make her feel her lack of relations. If two friends\\nwhispered together, she would think they were speaking of her; and any\\nsmall discourtesy, however unintentional, she put down as an indication\\nthat the others considered her inferior to themselves. She contrived to\\nmake herself thoroughly miserable with these ideas, and they had the\\nunfortunate effect of causing her to be even more abrupt and brusque\\nthan before. Sometimes one traitor thought would even steal in, and she\\nwould question whether Aunt Barbara really loved her as truly as if she\\nhad been her own flesh and blood; but this was such a monstrous and\\nunjust suspicion that Dorothy would thrust it from her in horror at\\nhaving ever entertained it.\\n\\nOne pleasure that she had at Avondale was her friendship with Alison\\nClarke. Owing to their daily companionship in the train, she had managed\\nto keep Alison pretty much to herself, and she watched over her with\\njealous eyes, unwilling to share her with anybody else. Alison had been\\naway from school on the day that the truants went to the wedding, and it\\nwas nearly a week before she returned. Each morning Dorothy had looked\\nout for her at Latchworth, and every time she had been disappointed. At\\nlast, however, the familiar little figure appeared again on the\\nplatform, and the round, rosy face smiled a greeting.\\n\\n\"No, I\\'ve not been very ill--only a bad cold. It\\'s almost gone now. Oh,\\nyes, I\\'m delighted to go back to the Coll. It\\'s so dull staying in the\\nhouse with nothing to do except read, and one gets sick to death of\\nchicken broth and jelly! I want somebody to tell me school news. It\\nseems more like a year than a week since I stopped at home.\"\\n\\nDorothy was accommodating in the matter of news, and the two chattered\\nhard all the way to Coleminster.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a fearful nuisance you\\'re out of rehearsals,\" said Alison. \"Can\\'t\\nwe all come up to the classroom and have them there instead?\"\\n\\n\"No; Miss Pitman won\\'t let us. We six sinners are on penance; we mayn\\'t\\ndo anything but read. Oh, it\\'s disgusting! I shall be out of the\\nChristmas performance altogether.\"\\n\\n\"No, you shan\\'t,\" declared Alison; \"not if I can compass it in any way.\"\\n\\nShe said no more just then, but when they were returning in the train\\nthat afternoon she mentioned the subject again.\\n\\n\"I was talking to the girls at dinner-time,\" she began. \"We were\\nplanning out the programme. Really, the scene from _Vanity Fair_ is very\\nshort. Hope says it won\\'t take as much time as the play you had last\\nyear, so I suggested that we should have some tableaux as well. You\\ncould do characters in those without any rehearsing. What do you think\\nof my idea?\"\\n\\n\"Ripping!\" said Dorothy. \"We haven\\'t had tableaux at the Coll. for ages.\\nBut we must manage to get hold of some decent costumes.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve heaps and heaps in a box at home,\" announced Alison complacently.\\n\"I can lend them all. We\\'ll get up something worth looking at. Tell me\\nwhat you\\'d like to be, and you shall have first choice of everything.\"\\n\\n\"It depends on what there is.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s a lovely mediaeval dress that would do for Berengaria of\\nNavarre.\"\\n\\n\"She had golden hair, and mine\\'s brown!\"\\n\\n\"Bother! so she had. Then that\\'s off. Never mind, there are heaps of\\nothers. There\\'s a Cavalier\\'s, if it will only fit. I wonder if it\\'s big\\nenough? You\\'d look nice with the crimson cloak and huge hat and feather.\\nOr there\\'s a Norwegian peasant\\'s--I think the skirt would be long\\nenough--and a Robin Hood jerkin and tall leather boots. I believe you\\ncould wear them. Oh dear! you ought to try all the things on. I wish I\\ncould show them to you. They\\'re kept in an oak chest on the landing.\"\\n\\n\"I should like to see them,\" said Dorothy pensively.\\n\\n\"Then look here! Get out with me at Latchworth and come to our house.\\nMother has gone to Bardsley this afternoon and won\\'t be home till seven,\\nso I shall be quite alone. You\\'d have heaps of time to come, and catch\\nthe next train on to Hurford.\"\\n\\nIt was a most tempting proposal. Dorothy wanted immensely to go. She\\nknew she was expected to come straight home from school every day, and\\nnot to accept any invitations without permission, but she dismissed that\\nremembrance as inconvenient.\\n\\n\"Auntie\\'ll only think I\\'ve missed the train. It will be all right if I\\ncatch the next,\" she reasoned. \"One must have a little fun sometimes,\\nand I\\'m getting too old to have to ask leave about everything. All\\nright, I\\'ll come,\" she added aloud; \"I\\'d just love to see those\\ncostumes.\"\\n\\nIt was delightful to get out of the train with Alison and walk to the\\nhouse on the hill which she had so often admired from the carriage\\nwindow. Dorothy was in wild spirits, and made jokes till Alison almost\\nchoked.\\n\\n\"It makes me cough to laugh so much,\" she protested. \"Do be sensible,\\nDorothy! Here we are. Leave your books and your umbrella in the porch.\\nWe\\'ll go straight upstairs.\"\\n\\nDorothy could not help looking round with interest as her friend led her\\nup the staircase. At every step her feet sank into the soft carpet.\\nThrough an open door she could catch a glimpse of a beautiful\\ndrawing-room, and beyond was a conservatory full of flowers. On the\\nlanding, which surrounded the hall like a gallery, were marble statues,\\npictures, and inlaid cabinets; and the floor was spread with Turkey\\nrugs. From the window she could see a tennis lawn and a vinery. After\\nthe modest proportions of Holly Cottage, it all seemed so spacious and\\nhandsome that Dorothy sighed.\\n\\n\"What a lovely house to live in!\" she thought. \"Alison is lucky. She\\'s\\nno foundling. I wish I had half her things. I wonder why some girls have\\nso much more than others?\"\\n\\nQuite unconscious of the storm of envy that she had roused, Alison\\nwalked on. She was so accustomed to her surroundings that it never\\nstruck her how they might appear to anyone else, and her sole thought\\nwas of the tableaux.\\n\\n\"Here\\'s the chest,\" she cried, lifting the lid in triumph, and\\ncommencing to pull out some of the dresses. \"This is the Norwegian\\npeasant\\'s--I knew it was on the top. Let me try the skirt by yours. Oh,\\nit is too short after all! Then you must have the mediaeval one. Look!\\nIsn\\'t it a beauty?--all trimmed with gold lace and spangles.\"\\n\\nDorothy examined the costume with appreciation, but shook her head\\nruefully.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t imagine that would meet round my waist?\" she enquired. \"It\\nlooks about eighteen inches. For whom was it made?\"\\n\\n\"Mother, before she was married. I always tell her, girls must have been\\nlike wasps in those days. Try the Cavalier\\'s. Oh, I don\\'t believe you\\ncan wear that either! You\\'re so big! I wish I could lop a little off\\nyou. Can\\'t you possibly squeeze into this?\"\\n\\n\"I would if I could, but no--I\\'m several sizes too large. Haven\\'t you\\nanything else?\"\\n\\n\"Not so nice. These are quite the best. You see, they\\'re made of really\\ngood materials, and the others are only of glazed calico and sateen.\\nI\\'ll tell you how we\\'ll manage. We must put several costumes together.\\nTake off your coat and hat and I\\'ll show you. Now, if you have the\\nmediaeval dress on first, we can tuck the bodice inside, and drape the\\nCavalier\\'s cloak like a pannier to cover the waist. The Norwegian bodice\\ngoes quite well with it, and that\\'s big enough, at any rate. Now this\\ngauze scarf round your shoulder, and this big hat, and there you are.\\nOh, it\\'s lovely!\"\\n\\n\"What am I intended to be?\" asked Dorothy, looking down at her\\nmiscellaneous finery.\\n\\n\"A Venetian lady in the time of the Doges. It is after the picture in\\nthe drawing-room. Oh, it is like! It\\'s simply splendid--you\\'ve no idea\\nhow good!\"\\n\\n\"What picture?\"\\n\\n\"The portrait of Aunt Madeleine in fancy dress. Why, Dorothy, you\\'re\\njust the living image of it! Come downstairs at once and let me show\\nyou. It\\'s perfect.\"\\n\\nQuite carried away by her own enthusiasm, Alison dragged Dorothy along\\nthe landing, the latter much encumbered by her long skirt and the\\nnecessity for holding on most of the articles of her attire.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t go so fast,\" she implored; \"I\\'m losing the pannier, and the hat\\'s\\nnearly bobbing off. If you\\'ll hold the train behind, I may manage\\nbetter.\"\\n\\n\"All right; but then I can\\'t see you--the back view isn\\'t nearly so\\nnice. This way--I have to steer you like a ship. Here\\'s the\\ndrawing-room. Now, take a good look in the glass first, and then please\\nadmire the picture.\"\\n\\nThe face that greeted Dorothy in the mirror was the prettiest version of\\nherself that she had ever seen. The quaint costume, the scarf, and the\\nbig hat suited her admirably; the excitement and fun had brought\\nunwonted roses to her cheeks, and her eyes were as bright as stars. She\\nhad had no idea that it was possible for her to look so well, and the\\nsurprise heightened the colour which was so becoming.\\n\\n\"Now the picture--look straight from yourself to the picture!\" commanded\\nAlison.\\n\\nThe portrait hanging on the opposite wall was that of a young lady of\\nperhaps seventeen. The face was pretty, with grey eyes and regular\\nfeatures; the splendid Venetian dress set off to advantage the dark\\ncurls and the graceful turn of the neck; the slender hands held a lute,\\nand the lips looked as if they had just closed after finishing the last\\nrefrain of a song. Whether it was the effect of the costume or not,\\nthere certainly was some resemblance between the face in the painting\\nand that of the girl who was scrutinizing it. Dorothy could see that for\\nherself, though the likeness did not seem so striking to her as it\\nappeared to her friend.\\n\\n\"You\\'re the absolute image!\" declared Alison. \"It might have been\\npainted directly from you. Bruce!\" (to a servant who was crossing the\\nhall) \"Bruce, come here! I want you to look. Did you ever see anything\\nso exact? Isn\\'t she Aunt Madeleine to the life?\"\\n\\nBruce gazed contemplatively from the painted face to the living one.\\n\\n\"The young lady certainly favours the picture,\" she said. \"I suppose\\nit\\'s the dress, and the way her hair\\'s done. Miss Alison, your tea\\'s\\nready. I\\'ve put it in the library this afternoon.\"\\n\\n\"Then bring another cup. Dorothy, you must stay and have tea with me.\\nYes, you must! You don\\'t know how I hate being alone, and Mother won\\'t\\nbe home till seven. Oh, do, do! You can\\'t think how much I want you.\"\\n\\n\"But I shall miss the 5.30!\"\\n\\n\"Never mind, you\\'ll get the next train. Isn\\'t there one at six? Bruce,\\nfetch the railway guide please. Oh, thanks! Now then, Coleminster to\\nHurford--where are we? Latchworth--yes, there\\'s one at 6.5. Dorothy,\\nyou\\'ll have oceans of time. I can\\'t let you go without tea.\"\\n\\nIt seemed a pity, when she was there, not to stay, so Dorothy argued. Of\\ncourse, Aunt Barbara would be getting rather anxious, but her mind would\\nsoon be set at rest afterwards, and Dorothy was not given to troubling\\nvery much about other people\\'s fears.\\n\\n\"It\\'s twenty-five past now,\" she said, looking at the Sèvres clock that\\nstood on a bracket. \"I should have a fearful rush to catch the 5.30.\"\\n\\n\"You couldn\\'t do it, so that settles the matter. Take off your costume\\nand come to the library. Oh, never mind folding the things up; Bruce\\nwill do that. Leave them anywhere.\"\\n\\nA dainty little tea awaited the girls in the library, an attractive room\\nto Dorothy, with its bookcases, filled with beautifully-bound volumes;\\nits big lacquered cabinet, and the many curios and Eastern weapons that\\nadorned the walls.\\n\\n\"Where do all these things come from?\" she asked, gazing round with\\ninterest while Alison wielded the teapot.\\n\\n\"Most of them are from India. My father was out there. Uncle David is at\\nDelhi still, only perhaps he\\'s coming home next year for good. Aunt\\nMadeleine died at Madras.\"\\n\\n\"The one in the picture?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; she and Uncle David had only been married quite a short time. She\\nwas Mother\\'s twin sister; but they weren\\'t the least scrap alike--Aunt\\nMadeleine was dark, and Mother is so very fair. Wasn\\'t it funny for\\ntwins? You\\'re far more like Aunt Madeleine than Mother is. That\\'s quite\\nabsurd, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Quite,\" agreed Dorothy.\\n\\n\"Uncle David sends me such lovely presents from India,\" continued\\nAlison, who liked to talk when she could find a listener. \"I\\'ve all\\nsorts of little scented boxes and things carved in ivory. I simply must\\nshow some of them to you. I\\'ll get them in half a second,\" and away she\\nfled, returning to spread the table with her treasures.\\n\\nTo Dorothy the meal was a mixture of cake, filigree ornaments,\\nblackberry jam, and sandalwood boxes.\\n\\n\"I wish we had some of the roseleaf preserve left,\" remarked Alison. \"It\\nwas the queerest stuff--rather too sickly, but I should like you to have\\ntasted it; it came from Kashmir. Look here, I want to give you one of\\nthese boxes; yes, you must take it! I\\'ve so many others, and I\\'d love\\nyou to have it. I\\'m going to put it in your pocket, and I shall be very\\noffended if you take it out.\"\\n\\nAlison crammed the box into Dorothy\\'s pocket as she spoke. It was the\\ngreatest pleasure to her to give a present, and she would willingly\\nhave bestowed far more of her treasures if she had thought there was a\\nlikelihood of their being accepted. She had enough delicacy and tact,\\nhowever, to understand that her proud little friend would not care to be\\npatronized, so she restrained her generosity for the present.\\n\\n\"It\\'s so delightful to have you here!\" she continued. \"Wouldn\\'t it be\\nlovely if you could come for a whole Saturday, or to stay the night some\\ntime? I\\'m going to ask Mother to ask you. We\\'d have such a jubilee! Can\\nyou play poker patience? Oh, I love it too! And I\\'ve the sweetest wee\\npacks of cards you ever saw. I want to show you my stamps and my crests.\\nI\\'ve got two big books full, and some are really rare ones. I\\'ll bring\\nthe stamps now.\"\\n\\n\"Alison, I simply can\\'t stay!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"Look at the time!\\nWhy, I shall just have to race to the station!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, bother! Yes, you\\'ll have to fly. I always allow five minutes. I\\'ve\\nnever tried running, because Mother says I mustn\\'t--it makes me cough.\\nWhere are your hat and coat? Why, of course, we left them on the\\nlanding. You haven\\'t finished your cake----\"\\n\\n\"Never mind!\" cried Dorothy, who was already out of the door and\\nhastening upstairs to fetch her outdoor garments. \"Oh, it\\'s been so\\njolly to come and see you, Alison! I have enjoyed it. Just hold my\\ncoat--thanks. I\\'m putting on my hat wrong way about! Bother! I\\'ll alter\\nit in the train. Where are my satchel and umbrella? Good-bye; I shall\\njust have to sprint.\"\\n\\nAlison stood looking regretfully down the drive as her friend hurried\\naway. She was loath to part with her, and turned indoors with a sigh.\\nShe dearly loved young companions, and the beautiful house and its many\\ntreasures seemed dull without a congenial soul of her own age with whom\\nto \"go shares\". She was full of Dorothy\\'s visit when her mother returned\\nhome, and poured out a most excited and rather jumbled account of it.\\n\\n\"It just suddenly occurred to me to ask her, you know, Mother, because I\\ndid so want her to try on those costumes. She put on the mediaeval one,\\nand the Cavalier\\'s cloak and hat, and the Norwegian bodice, and then she\\nlooked exactly like the picture of Aunt Madeleine. Wasn\\'t it queer?\"\\n\\n\"I dare say the combination of costumes made quite a good copy of the\\nVenetian dress,\" responded Mrs. Clarke.\\n\\n\"But it wasn\\'t the dress that was so like--it was Dorothy. You never saw\\nanything so funny, Mother! She was the absolute image of the\\nportrait--far more like than I am to you. Even Bruce saw it.\"\\n\\n\"You take after your father, not me.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know who Dorothy takes after, and I don\\'t suppose she does\\neither. She\\'s never seen her father or mother. She doesn\\'t even know who\\nthey were. Isn\\'t it horrid for her?\"\\n\\n\"How is that?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s quite romantic! Some of the girls at school told me, but I\\ndaren\\'t say a word about it to Dorothy, she\\'s so proud and reserved. I\\nnever even hint at it. Miss Sherbourne--that\\'s her aunt--at least, not\\nher real aunt--oh! I\\'m getting muddled--well, Miss Sherbourne found her\\nin the train when she was a baby--there was a dreadful railway accident\\nat a place called Greenfield, and that\\'s why she\\'s called Dorothy\\nGreenfield--but it isn\\'t her proper name, because they don\\'t know\\nthat--they never found out who she was--and Miss Sherbourne adopted her,\\nand Dorothy always calls her Auntie, though she\\'s no relation at all.\\nAnd Hope Lawson says Dorothy\\'s a charity child, and her parents may have\\nbeen quite poor; but I\\'m sure she\\'s a lady, because--well--because she\\nsomehow seems to have it in her. I think she\\'s just lovely, and I like\\nher better than anyone else at school.\"\\n\\n\"Where did you hear this amazing story, Birdie?\" exclaimed Mrs. Clarke.\\n\\n\"I told you, Mother dear--at the Coll. All the girls know about it. They\\ncall Dorothy \\'The Foundling\\' behind her back. Nobody dares to say it to\\nher face, because she gets into such tantrums. I think it makes her so\\ninteresting. She may be the daughter of a nobleman, for what anyone\\nknows. Just imagine! Suppose she found out that her father was a duke!\\nThen she\\'d be Lady Dorothy. Don\\'t you think, Mother, she looks\\naristocratic? I do.\"\\n\\n\"I think you\\'re a very silly child,\" returned Mrs. Clarke, with a\\ndistinct tone of annoyance in her voice. \"You must not bring girls to\\nthe house without asking me first.\"\\n\\n\"But, Mother darling, you weren\\'t in this afternoon, and I\\'d thought of\\nthe tableaux, and I couldn\\'t arrange any of the parts until I knew what\\ndresses would fit Dorothy. I simply had to get her to come and try them\\non. And it was such fun having her to tea. Mayn\\'t I ask her to spend the\\nday here next Saturday? Oh, and if you would let her stay until Monday,\\nwe\\'d have such a glorious time!\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not; I couldn\\'t think of such a thing,\" replied Mrs. Clark\\ndecisively.\\n\\n\"But, Mother--Mother dearest--why not? You said yourself what a nice\\ngirl she looked that first day we saw her in the train, and how glad you\\nwere that I had her to travel to school with.\"\\n\\n\"That was quite a different matter.\"\\n\\n\"But why shouldn\\'t I have her to the house? Oh, Mother, I told Dorothy\\nthat I meant to ask you to invite her, and if you don\\'t I shall feel so\\nsilly. What could I say to her? Mother sweetest, please, please!\"\\n\\n\"You have no right to give invitations without consulting me first,\\nBirdie,\" said Mrs. Clarke, who looked more displeased than her daughter\\nremembered ever having seen her before. \"I cannot allow you to make\\nfriends with girls of whom I know nothing.\"\\n\\n\"But you\\'d know her if she came here, Motherkins.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t wish to--nor do I want you to continue the acquaintance. No,\\nBirdie, it is impossible. I absolutely forbid you to ask this Dorothy\\nGreenfield here again.\"\\n\\nIt was the first time Mrs. Clarke had ever set her will in direct\\nopposition to Alison\\'s, and the spoilt child could hardly realize that\\nshe was not to be allowed, as usual, to do as she liked. She burst out\\ninto a final appeal.\\n\\n\"But, Mother, I love Dorothy! We\\'re always together. You don\\'t know what\\nchums we are at school. If you only guessed half of how much I want it,\\nyou\\'d say yes.\"\\n\\n\"But I say no, Birdie,\" answered Mrs. Clarke, firm for once in her life.\\n\"I strongly discourage this acquaintance, and you must not be more\\nfriendly with Dorothy than you can help. I prefer you to travel to\\nschool in another carriage.\"\\n\\n\"How can I? What explanation could I possibly give? It would seem so\\npeculiar to cut her for no reason at all.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose you will have to be civil, but you must not be intimate. You\\nare to see no more of her than you can help. It is very annoying that\\nshe goes by the same train. In such a large school as Avondale there are\\nsurely plenty of other and more suitable girls with whom you can make\\nfriends.\"\\n\\n\"Not one so nice as Dorothy,\" gulped Alison, beginning to cry. \"If you\\'d\\nonly ask her, and see for yourself!\"\\n\\n\"Birdie, I don\\'t want to be cross with you, but you must understand,\\nonce and for all, that I will not have this girl at the house. No, I\\nshall not explain; it is quite enough for you that I forbid it. Don\\'t\\nmention the subject to me again.\"\\n\\nAlison ran upstairs in floods of tears. She could not understand why her\\nmother had taken this sudden prejudice against Dorothy. The thought of\\nbreaking off the friendship was misery to her; added to this, she was so\\nused to getting her own way that it seemed strange to have any\\nreasonable request refused--and she considered this one to be most\\nreasonable. In matters of health she was accustomed to obey, to submit\\nto be wrapped up in shawls, to put on galoshes, to be kept in bed and\\ndosed and dieted; but where her health was not concerned she had almost\\ninvariably been consulted, and her wishes gratified. It was the first\\ntime her mother had ever flatly refused to listen to her coaxings, or\\nhad spoken to her with the least approach to severity, and such a state\\nof affairs was as unpleasant as it was unusual.\\n\\n\"She really meant it, too,\" sobbed Alison. \"Oh, dear! What am I to do?\\nDorothy\\'ll think me such an atrocious sneak!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nA Short Cut\\n\\n\\nWhen Dorothy left Lindenlea she had exactly three minutes in which to\\ncatch her train. Her long legs raced down the drive and along the road\\nto the station. Panting and out of breath, she rushed up the incline to\\nthe little gate. The train had come in; she could see the smoke from the\\nengine. It generally only waited for about a minute, but there was still\\ntime to get in, if she were extremely quick.\\n\\n\"Ticket, please,\" said the collector at the gate.\\n\\n\"Contract!\" cried Dorothy, trying to rush past; but the man put out his\\narm to bar the way.\\n\\n\"Show it, please; I must see all contracts,\" he said curtly.\\n\\nChafing at the delay, Dorothy felt in her pocket; then to her dismay she\\nremembered that she had left her contract at home. The officials at\\nHurford and Coleminster knew her so well by sight that when once they\\nhad seen her season ticket on the first day of the term, they never\\nasked to look at it again, but simply let her pass unchallenged. As she\\nwas not required to produce it daily, she had grown careless, and often\\nforgot to take it with her. The collector at Latchworth had not seen her\\nbefore, and of course could not tell that she possessed a season ticket\\nat all.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve left it at home, but it\\'s a contract between Hurford and\\nColeminster. You\\'ll find it\\'s quite right. Please let me through. I must\\ncatch this train,\" she urged.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t let anyone pass without a ticket,\" answered the man. \"If you\\nhaven\\'t your contract you must book an ordinary fare. Booking office is\\nround that corner.\"\\n\\nDorothy stamped with impatience.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t any money with me, and there isn\\'t time either. Let me pass,\\nquick! The train\\'s going!\"\\n\\nIn reply, the man shut the gate and locked it.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t let anybody on to the platform when the train\\'s in motion. You\\'ll\\nhave to wait till the eight o\\'clock now,\" he observed, with aggravating\\ncalm.\\n\\nOn the outside of the railing, Dorothy almost wept with rage. To see the\\ntrain steaming out of the station without her was too exasperating.\\nThere would have been quite time to catch it if the collector had not\\nbeen so full of \"red tape\" notions. She felt angrier than she could\\nexpress, especially at the cool way in which the man had told her to\\nwait till eight o\\'clock. Eight o\\'clock! It was impossible. Why, Aunt\\nBarbara would think she was lost or stolen! She was late enough as it\\nwas, and other two hours would be dreadful. Then, again, there was the\\nquestion of her ticket. The official evidently would not accept her word\\nfor the contract if she could not produce the actual piece of\\npasteboard, and she had no money to book with. Should she run back to\\nLindenlea and ask Alison to lend her the fare? No; Mrs. Clarke might\\nhave returned by now, and it would make such a fuss. Dorothy always\\nhated to ask favours, or put herself in a false position. She felt that\\nto turn up at the house again, wanting to borrow a few pence, would be a\\nmost undignified proceeding, and would exhibit her in an unfavourable\\nlight to her school-mate\\'s mother.\\n\\n\"I\\'d rather walk home than do that,\" she said to herself.\\n\\nThe idea was a good one. Why should she not walk home? It was only about\\nfour miles, and she would arrive at Hurford much sooner than if she\\nwaited for the train. To be sure, it was growing very dusk, but she was\\nnot in the least afraid. \"I\\'m perfectly capable of taking care of\\nmyself,\" she thought. \"If I met a tramp and he attacked me, I\\'d belabour\\nhim with my umbrella. But I\\'ve nothing on me worth stealing; my brooch\\nis only an eighteenpenny one, and I don\\'t possess a watch.\"\\n\\nDorothy generally made up her mind quickly, so without further delay\\nshe walked down the station incline and turned on to the high road that\\nled to Hurford. She had soon passed through the straggling village of\\nLatchworth, where lights were already beginning to appear in cottage\\nwindows, and labourers were returning home from work. As she passed the\\nlast little stone-roofed dwelling she looked back almost regretfully,\\nfor it seemed like leaving civilization behind her. In front the road\\nstretched straight and white between high hedges, without ever a\\nfriendly chimney to show that human beings were near.\\n\\nDorothy suddenly remembered all the tales that Martha had told her, in\\nher childhood, of children who were stolen by gipsies and carried away\\nin caravans to sell brooms or dance in a travelling circus. She knew\\nthat Martha had rubbed in the moral so as to deter her from straying out\\nof the gate of Holly Cottage when she was left to play alone in the\\ngarden, and that the stories were probably made up for the\\noccasion--Dorothy at fourteen did not mean to be frightened, as if she\\nwere seven--but, all the same, the old creepy horror which she used to\\nfeel came back and haunted her. The road was so very lonely, and it was\\ngrowing dark so fast! Suppose a gipsy caravan appeared round the next\\ncorner, and a dark, hawk-visaged woman were to demand her hat and\\njacket! What would she do? The supposition made her shiver. She walked\\non steadily all the same, her footsteps sounding loud in her ears.\\n\\nThen she stopped, for in front of her she heard the unmistakable creak\\nof a cart. Was it a band of gipsies or travelling pedlars? At school, in\\ndaylight, she would have mocked at herself for having any fears at all,\\nbut now she found her heart was beating and throbbing in the most absurd\\nand uncomfortable fashion. \"I\\'m in a horrid scare,\" she thought. \"I\\ndaren\\'t meet whatever\\'s coming, and that\\'s the fact. I\\'m going to hide\\ntill it\\'s passed.\"\\n\\nThere was a gate not very far away; she managed to open it, and crept\\ninto a field, concealing herself well behind the hedge. The creaking\\ncame nearer and nearer. Through a hole Dorothy could see down into the\\nroadway. By a curious coincidence, it was a caravan that was passing\\nslowly in the direction of Latchworth; the outside was hung with\\nbaskets, and there was a little black chimney that poured out a cloud of\\nsmoke. Two thin, tired horses paced wearily along, urged by an\\noccasional prod with a stick from a rough-looking boy. A swinging\\nlantern under the body of the vehicle revealed a couple of dogs, and in\\nthe rear slouched three men and a slipshod, untidy woman, who twisted up\\nher straggling hair as she went. Hidden behind the hedge, Dorothy\\nwatched them go by.\\n\\n\"I\\'m most thankful I came up here and didn\\'t meet them,\" she thought.\\n\"They look a disreputable set. I believe they\\'d have stolen anything\\nthey could lay hands on if they\\'d realized I was alone. I expect I\\'ve\\nhad quite an escape. I wonder if that\\'s the whole of the tribe, or if\\nthere are any more caravans?\"\\n\\nThe idea of more was discomfiting, yet it was possible that this was\\nonly the first of a travelling company. Dorothy remembered that there\\nwere some wakes at Coleminster about this time every year, which would\\nno doubt attract van-dwellers from many parts of the country. To meet a\\nsuccession of these undesirables along the road would be anything but\\npleasant. Yet what could she do? She certainly did not want to turn back\\neither to the station or to Lindenlea. Time was passing rapidly, and she\\nmust push forward if she did not wish to be caught in the dark. Then she\\nremembered that Martha had once spoken of a short cut between Hurford\\nand Latchworth. Martha walked over occasionally on Sunday afternoons to\\nsee a cousin who lived in Latchworth village, and she had given a minute\\ndescription of the route. Dorothy recollected quite well that, starting\\nfrom Hurford, the maid had crossed some fields, gone through a wood, and\\ncome out by a path that led through a small, disused quarry on to the\\nhigh road. She had said it cut off a long corner, and saved almost a\\nmile.\\n\\n\"If I can only find the quarry,\" thought Dorothy, \"I\\'ll try that short\\ncut. I don\\'t suppose I can go wrong if I follow the path through the\\nwood. I shall be glad to get off the road, at any rate.\"\\n\\nThe caravan had passed out of sight, so she came down from her\\nhiding-place and hurried on in search of the quarry. She had not walked\\nvery far before she found it--a craggy little ravine, with heather\\ngrowing over the rocks, and heaps of stones and shale lying about. This\\nmust surely be the place, so she turned at once off the high road into\\nit. There was not a soul about. Some agitated blackbirds, annoyed at her\\nvicinity, went fluttering out of the bushes, tweeting a warning to\\nother feathered friends; and something small--either a rat or a\\nrabbit--scuttled away into the grass and dried fern in a great panic at\\nthe sight of her. The sun had set some time ago, and the last tinge of\\nred had faded from the sky. The grey, chilly dusk was changing from a\\nneutral tint to black. A landscape on an evening at the beginning of\\nNovember is never very cheerful, and Dorothy felt the depressing\\ninfluence of the scene. The few wind-swept trees at the head of the\\nravine stretched long, bare branches, which looked like fingers prepared\\nto clutch her as she passed. The grass was damp and sodden, and here and\\nthere a pool of water lay across the path. She was quite glad when she\\nwas out of the quarry, and found herself in an open field. It was a\\ncomfort to see the sky all round, even though the light was failing.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure it\\'s grown dark to-night much quicker than it did yesterday,\"\\nshe exclaimed. \"How fearfully overcast it is, too! I believe there\\'ll be\\nrain in a few minutes. Here\\'s the wood. It looks quite thick and\\nfairy-tale-y--the sort of place to meet a giant or an ogre!\"\\n\\nA stile led from the field into the wood. Dorothy scrambled over, and\\nbegan to follow a path through the trees. It was very dark indeed, for\\nmost of the oaks still kept their leaves, and shut out the little\\nremaining light overhead. She could just see to stumble along, and had\\nthe greatest difficulty to trace her way. It was wet under foot; the\\nground was marshy in places, and strewn with dead leaves. After a little\\nwhile she came to a place where the path seemed to branch in two\\ndirections. Which to choose she could not tell; both seemed equally bad\\nand indistinguishable. Reckoning that Hurford must lie to the left side\\nof her, she turned to the left, almost feeling her way among the trees.\\n\\n\"If I don\\'t get out of the wood soon, I shan\\'t be able to see at all. I\\nhope it\\'s not far,\" she thought. The path grew a trifle better; there\\nwere a few stones put down on it. Was she at last coming to a stile?\\nWhat was that dark patch in front of her? She stopped short suddenly,\\ndrawing back just in time to avoid stepping into water. Why, it must be\\na well! It was a deep pool, edged round with stones, and with a hedge of\\nholly surrounding it on three sides.\\n\\nPerhaps the path led by the back of it. No; the bushes were so thickly\\nmatted with a tangle of brambles that it would be impossible to push\\nthrough. Evidently the path only led to the well, and she must have\\ntaken the wrong turning where it had branched. Almost crying, she began\\nto retrace her steps, and hurried faster and faster through the\\ngathering darkness. She was back at last at the spot where she had made\\nthe mistake, and this time she turned to the right. The trees seemed to\\nbe even nearer together than before, and there was a thick undergrowth\\nwhich sent out long blackberry trails that caught and tore her coat as\\nshe scurried by. She had slung her school satchel on her back, and as\\nshe ran it bumped her shoulder almost like somebody hitting her from\\nbehind.\\n\\n[Illustration: IN DISCREET HIDING]\\n\\nIt grew so dark at last that Dorothy stopped in despair. It seemed\\nabsolutely impossible to find her way, and the horrible truth dawned\\nupon her that she was lost--lost as thoroughly and effectually as any\\nknight of romance; while it seemed extremely unlikely that she would\\nfind the convenient pilgrim\\'s cell or hermit\\'s cave that generally turns\\nup in story-books to shelter the adventurer. To add to her misery, the\\nrain that had been threatening for some time came on, and descended in a\\ntorrent. She put up her umbrella and sheltered herself as well as she\\ncould behind a tree, but her boots and skirt were already sopping with\\nwet. She felt chilly and cold, and her spirits had descended to the very\\nlowest ebb. Would she be obliged to stay there the whole night, until it\\nwas light enough to find her way? The prospect was appalling.\\n\\n\"What a horrid pickle and hobble I\\'ve got myself into!\" she thought. The\\nrain came down faster than ever, and suddenly there was a vivid streak\\nof lightning and a loud crash of thunder. Dorothy screamed aloud, for\\nthunder held terrors for her; yet even in the midst of her fright there\\nwas a grain of comfort--the bright flash had lit up the wood like an\\nelectric lamp, and had shown her, almost within a few yards, the stile\\nfor which she was seeking. Off she went in the direction where she had\\nseen it, groping her way anyhow, and tearing her clothes on thorns and\\nbrambles.\\n\\nShe seemed to have arrived at a hedge, and she began to feel her way\\nalong it carefully, hoping to reach the stile. At last her hand touched\\na wooden bar; it was either the stile itself or a hurdle, she did not\\ncare which, if only she could climb over. It looked equally dark,\\nhowever, on the other side; and even if she got into the field how was\\nshe ever to find the path to the high road? At this juncture she saw a\\nsmall, rather flickering light moving through the gloom a little\\ndistance off. It must be a lantern, she thought; and whether the bearer\\nwere poacher, gipsy, or thief, she would summon him to help her out of\\nher difficulty. She gave a lusty shriek, and went on calling at the top\\nof her voice. The lantern stopped still for a moment, then, to her\\nintense joy, began to move in her direction. At first she could see\\nnothing but a yellow ring of light, then she made out a dark figure\\nbehind; and presently, as it came quite near, she recognized the ruddy\\nface and stubby grey beard of Dr. Longton, who lived in Hurford village,\\nnearly opposite the church. Dorothy\\'s amazement at seeing the doctor was\\nonly equalled by his astonishment at finding her in such a predicament.\\n\\n\"My blessed child! What are you doing here?\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n\"Oh, Dr. Longton, I\\'m so thankful it\\'s you! I was sure you were a tramp,\\nor a poacher, or somebody dreadful!\" cried Dorothy hysterically.\\n\\n\"Nothing half so interesting; only a common or garden practitioner\\ncoming back from visiting a patient,\" he laughed. \"You haven\\'t told me\\nwhat you\\'re doing here. Give me your hand, and I\\'ll help you over the\\nfence.\"\\n\\n\"Trying to find a short cut, and losing my way,\" confessed Dorothy. \"I\\nthought I\\'d have to spend the night in the wood.\"\\n\\n\"A very unpleasant camping ground at this time of year! I\\'ve slept under\\nthe stars myself once or twice, but not in November. That was a loud\\npeal of thunder! I think the storm\\'s passing over--the rain has almost\\nstopped.\"\\n\\nWith his lantern to guide them, the doctor escorted Dorothy to the door\\nof Holly Cottage, and said good-bye with a twinkle in his eye.\\n\\n\"I won\\'t ask inconvenient questions, but it strikes me you\\'ve been up to\\nsomething, you young puss!\" he said. \"Take my advice, and stick to the\\n4.30 train in future. If your aunt scolds you, tell her I say you\\ndeserve it!\"\\n\\nAunt Barbara did not scold--she was too relieved at her bairn\\'s safe\\nreturn to do anything except welcome and cosset the prodigal; but the\\nlook in her sweet eyes hurt Dorothy more than any reprimand.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know she cared so much as that,\" thought the girl. \"I won\\'t\\nstop away another time, not for a thousand invitations. It isn\\'t the\\nhorrid walk, and getting lost, and the darkness, and spoiling one\\'s\\nclothes I mind, it\\'s--well--oh, Dorothy Greenfield, you\\'re a nasty,\\nthoughtless, selfish wretch to make Aunt Barbara look so, and if you do\\nsuch a thing again I shan\\'t be friends with you any more--so there!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nDorothy Scores\\n\\n\\nDorothy and Alison met next morning with a shade of embarrassment on\\neither side. Dorothy was a little ashamed of herself for having accepted\\nher friend\\'s invitation without leave from Aunt Barbara, and not\\nparticularly proud of her experiences on the way home. She had at first\\nbeen inclined to tell Alison about her adventure; then she decided it\\nwould be rather humiliating to have to explain that she had forgotten\\nher contract, that she had had no money in her pocket, and that the\\nofficial had not seemed disposed to trust her for her fare. Alison,\\nwhose path in life was always smooth, would perhaps scarcely understand\\nthe situation, and it might not reflect altogether to her own credit.\\nTherefore, she did not even mention that she had missed the 6.5 train,\\nand after a hurried greeting buried herself in her books, trying to\\ngather some idea of her lessons, which had been much neglected the night\\nbefore.\\n\\nAlison, on her side, was relieved that Dorothy did not refer to her\\nvisit to Lindenlea. She was most anxious to avoid the subject of her\\ninvitation; she felt it would be extremely awkward to be obliged to tell\\nDorothy point-blank that her mother refused to endorse it: and, mindful\\nof the prohibition against too great intimacy, she left her schoolfellow\\nto her books, and made no advances. The two walked from the station to\\nthe College almost in silence, each occupied with her own thoughts; and\\nthough they met frequently during the day, and travelled back together\\nas usual, they only talked about ordinary Avondale topics. Each felt as\\nwarm towards the other as before, but both realized that theirs must be\\na friendship entirely confined to school, and not brought into their\\nhome lives. Dorothy, though she was far too proud to hint at the matter,\\neasily divined that Mrs. Clarke had disapproved of Alison\\'s action in\\ntaking her to the house, and that she did not mean to give her any\\nfuture invitation. That hurt her on a sore spot.\\n\\n\"She thinks me a nobody!\" she groaned to herself. \"If I had been Hope\\nLawson, now, or even Val Barnett, I\\'m sure I should have been asked.\\nAlison hasn\\'t even mentioned the tableaux again. I suppose she\\'s not\\nallowed to lend me the costume. Well, I don\\'t care; I\\'ll wear something\\nelse.\"\\n\\nBut she did care, not only about this, but about many things that\\nhappened in class. It is not pleasant to be unpopular, and in several\\nways Dorothy was having a hard term. Hope Lawson, who had never been\\nvery friendly at any time, seemed to have completely turned against her,\\nand was both supercilious and disagreeable. Hope did not like Dorothy,\\nwhose blunt, downright ways and frank speech were such a contrast to her\\nown easy flippancy. Money, position, and pretty clothes were what Hope\\nworshipped, and because Dorothy possessed none of these she looked down\\nupon her, and lost no opportunity of slighting her. In her capacity of\\nWarden, Hope naturally had much influence in the class, and led popular\\nopinion. It was very unfortunate that she had been elected, for she was\\nquite the wrong girl to fill a post which involved a tolerable amount of\\nmoral responsibility. The tone of a Form is a subtle, intangible thing;\\nit means certain codes of schoolgirl honour, certain principles of right\\nand wrong, certain standards of thought and views of life, all of which\\nneed keeping at a high level. Under Hope\\'s rule the Upper Fourth began\\nto show a general slackness; rules were evaded where possible, work was\\nshirked, and a number of undesirable elements crept in.\\n\\nThough Hope, to curry favour, made a great fuss of Miss Pitman to her\\nface, she was not loyal to her behind her back. She would often mimic\\nher and make fun of her to raise a laugh among the girls. Hope\\nencouraged the idea that a mistress was the natural enemy of her pupils,\\nand that they were justified in breaking rules if they could do so\\nsafely. She did not even draw the line sometimes at a \"white lie\"; her\\nmotto was, \"Keep pleasant with your teacher on the surface, but please\\nyourself when she can\\'t see you, and do anything you like, so long as\\nyou\\'re not caught\".\\n\\nOne morning when Dorothy came into the classroom, she found Hope seated\\non her desk, exhibiting a new ring to a group of admiring friends.\\nDorothy paused a moment, then, as nobody moved, she protested:\\n\\n\"I\\'ll thank you to clear off. I want to get to my desk.\"\\n\\nHope giggled.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll thank you to wait a little, then. I mean to stay where I am for\\nthe present,\" she said, in a mocking voice.\\n\\n\"But you\\'re on my desk!\"\\n\\n\"Well, what if I am? A warden has the right to sit upon anybody\\'s desk\\nshe likes.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Hope!\" sniggered the others.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the good of being Warden if you can\\'t? The post must have some\\nadvantages.\"\\n\\n\"Hope Lawson, do you intend to clear off my desk?\" asked Dorothy, with\\nrising temper.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know that I do, Dorothy--er--I suppose your name is\\nGreenfield?\"\\n\\n\"For shame, Hope!\" said Grace Russell. \"I\\'m disgusted with you. Why\\ncan\\'t you move?\"\\n\\nGrace enforced her words by a vigorous tug, and drew Hope away to her\\nown place. With two flaming spots in her cheeks, Dorothy opened her\\ndesk. She was too angry for speech. Grace\\'s compassionate looks hurt her\\nalmost as much as Hope\\'s insult. She did not want pity any more than\\nscorn.\\n\\n\"I hardly know a word of the History,\" Hope was saying. \"We had some\\nfriends in last night, and we were all playing \\'Billy-rag\\'. Do you know\\nit? It\\'s a new game, and it\\'s lovely. I scarcely looked at my lessons.\\nHowever, I begged a concert ticket from Father, and brought it for\\nPittie. It\\'s \\'Faust\\', at the Town Hall, and it\\'s supposed to be tiptop.\\nShe\\'ll let me off easy this morning, you\\'ll see.\"\\n\\n\"Hope, you\\'re not fair!\" objected Grace.\\n\\n\"Why not? If Pittie chooses to overlook my lessons on the score of\\nconcert tickets, why shouldn\\'t she? She\\'s keen on going to things. Likes\\nto show off her new dresses. I suppose I shall have to get her an\\ninvitation to the Mayor\\'s reception. By the by, who\\'s going to the Young\\nPeople\\'s Ball at the Town Hall? It\\'s to be a particularly good one this\\nyear.\"\\n\\n\"I am, for one,\" said Val Barnett, \"and I think a good many of the Form\\nwill be there. Helen Walker, and Joyce Hickson, and Annie Gray are\\nasked, I know.\"\\n\\n\"Are you going, Dorothy?\" enquired Hope, with a taunt in her tone.\\n\\n\"Dorothy never goes anywhere!\" laughed Blanche Hall.\\n\\nDorothy buried her head in her desk and took no notice; but her silence\\nwas pain and grief to her.\\n\\n\"Hope\\'s too mean for anything!\" whispered Ruth Harmon to Noëlle Kennedy.\\n\"I\\'m sorry for Dorothy.\"\\n\\n\"And Pittie\\'s too bad. It\\'s not worth while preparing one\\'s work if Hope\\ngets all the praise for nothing. Why is Pittie always so hard on\\nDorothy?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, because Dorothy doesn\\'t flatter her up; besides, she loves\\npresents. I wonder what she\\'d say if she could hear what her darling\\nHope says about her sometimes?\"\\n\\n\"I wish she\\'d find her out.\"\\n\\n\"She can\\'t, unless someone tells, and I hate sneaks.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m really sorry for Dorothy Greenfield. Hope and her set seem to\\nhave taken a spite against her. I don\\'t mind if her dresses are shabby,\\nand if she\\'s the only girl in the Form who doesn\\'t own a watch. I vote\\nwe make up a special clique to be on her side.\"\\n\\n\"All right; I\\'m your man! I admire Dorothy she\\'s so \\'game\\'--she never\\ngives way an inch, whatever Hope says she just sticks her head in the\\nair and looks proud.\"\\n\\n\"She flares up sometimes.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t blame her. I like a girl who won\\'t be kept down.\"\\n\\n\"What could we do to boost Dorothy up a little in the Form? Most of the\\ngirls are like sheep; if anyone leads hard enough, they\\'ll follow.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ve an idea.\"\\n\\n\"Go ahead!\"\\n\\n\"You know Dorothy\\'s splendid at acting. She ought to take a principal\\npart in our Christmas play.\"\\n\\n\"But she can\\'t rehearse. She\\'s barred the gym. and tied to the classroom\\nfor the rest of the term.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s my point. I think Dorothy got much too hard a punishment. Miss\\nTempest was angry because she answered back, and never took into account\\nthat she had owned up about going to that wedding, and that it was\\nhonest of her to tell.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, \\'The Storm-cloud\\' was savage because Dorothy was cheeky, but I\\nthink she\\'s got over it a little now; she\\'s been far nicer to her\\nlately.\"\\n\\n\"Have you noticed that too? Well, I believe Miss Tempest knows she\\ntreated Dorothy severely, and she\\'s sorry, only she doesn\\'t like to eat\\nher own words. My plan is that we get up a deputation, go to the study,\\nand beg her to let Dorothy off for rehearsals. She knows what a point we\\nmake of the play.\"\\n\\n\"Splendiferous! I verily believe we shall succeed. Shall we go at\\neleven?\"\\n\\n\"No; we must talk to the others first, and get up as big a deputation as\\nwe can. The more of us who ask, the better.\"\\n\\nThe weather, which beforetimes had never troubled Dorothy overmuch, was\\nat present a subject of the most vital importance to her. If it were\\nfine, she might go into the playground at one o\\'clock; but if it were\\nwet, she was obliged to remain in durance vile in the classroom, while\\nmost of the girls were amusing themselves in the gymnasium. On this\\nparticular day it poured. Dorothy looked hopelessly out of the window to\\nsee the gravelled stretch, where the girls often practised hockey,\\nturned into a swamp, and a river racing under the swings. With a groan\\nshe resigned herself to the inevitable. The society of her five\\nfellow-victims was not particularly exhilarating, so she took a library\\nbook from her desk and began to read. As a rule, those who were free to\\ndo so left the schoolroom only too readily, but to-day Hope Lawson and\\nsome of her chums lingered behind. They were in a silly mood, and began\\ndrawing caricatures on the blackboard.\\n\\n\"Watch me do Professor Schenk,\" cried Hope, taking the chalk. \"Here\\'s\\nhis bald head, and his double chin, and his funny little peaked beard.\\nDo you like it? Well, I\\'ll draw you another. Miss Lawson\\'s celebrated\\nlightning sketches! Who\\'ll you have next?\"\\n\\n\"Do Pittie,\" said Blanche.\\n\\n\"All right; give me the duster and I\\'ll wipe out the Professor. Now\\nthen, how\\'s this? Here\\'s her snubby nose, and her eyeglasses, and her\\nfashionable fuzz of hair. She\\'s smirking no end! \\'Don\\'t I look nice?\\'\\nshe\\'s saying,\" and Hope drew a balloon issuing from the mouth of the\\nportrait, with the words \"Don\\'t I look nice?\" written inside; then,\\nencouraged by the laughter of her friends, she added \"G. A. Pitman,\\notherwise Pittie\", over the top.\\n\\nDorothy, who wished to read her story, had retired to the extreme back\\nof the room, and sat in a corner, but she nevertheless heard all that\\nwas going on.\\n\\n\"Yes, Pittie fancies herself,\" continued Hope. \"You should see what\\ncostumes she comes out in for evening wear. I\\'m sure she\\'s greater on\\ntoilet hints than literature.\"\\n\\n\"How do you make that out?\"\\n\\n\"Observation, my dear. If you could look inside her desk, you wouldn\\'t\\nfind it full of classical authors; there\\'d be novels and beauty recipes\\ninstead.\"\\n\\n\"She keeps it locked, at any rate.\"\\n\\n\"Wise of her, too. If we could only open it now! Hallo! She\\'s actually\\nforgotten to lock it to-day! What a joke! Let us see what she\\'s got\\nhere!\"\\n\\n\"Particularly honourable for a warden!\" came a voice from the other end\\nof the room.\\n\\nHope turned round angrily.\\n\\n\"Indeed, Madam Sanctimonious! So you\\'ve grown a prig all of a sudden?\\nWho asked Saint Dorothy to interfere?\"\\n\\n\"Go on, Hope,\" said Blanche; \"we\\'re not goody-goody.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I mean to have a look, at any rate. There! Didn\\'t I tell you? The\\nfirst thing I find is a novel. What a heap of papers! I believe she must\\nkeep her love letters here. Oh, girls, I say, here\\'s a portrait of a\\ngentleman!\"\\n\\nBlanche, Irene, and Valentine came crowding round, all sense of honour\\nlost in their curiosity.\\n\\n\"Oh, what a supreme joke!\" they exclaimed.\\n\\nNow the back desks of the classroom were raised on a platform, and in\\nthe corner where Dorothy sat there was a tiny window that served the\\npurpose of lighting the passage. From her place Dorothy that moment\\ncaught a vision--no less a person than Miss Pitman herself was walking\\ndown the corridor. Should she give a warning \"Cave!\" and let the others\\nknow? She was not sure whether they deserved it.\\n\\n\"Look here, you wouldn\\'t be doing this if Miss Pitman could see you!\"\\nshe remonstrated. \"Why don\\'t you stuff those things back and shut up the\\ndesk?\"\\n\\n\"Shut up yourself, Dorothy Greenfield, and mind your own business!\"\\n\\n\"On your heads be it, then,\" muttered Dorothy. \"I tried to save you, but\\nhere comes swift vengeance!\"\\n\\nAt that moment through the open door walked Miss Pitman. She stopped\\nshort and surveyed the scene through her pince-nez. There was her\\nportrait on the blackboard--not at all a flattering one, especially with\\nthe inscription issuing from her mouth, but quite unmistakably meant to\\nrepresent her, for her name was written above. At her open desk were her\\nfour favourite pupils, giggling over the photograph which Hope held\\naloft. It was a disillusionment for any teacher, and Miss Pitman\\'s mouth\\ntwitched.\\n\\n\"What are you doing at my desk?\" she asked sharply.\\n\\nNo girls were ever so hopelessly caught. Hope remained with the\\nphotograph in her hand, staring speechlessly; Blanche tried to shuffle\\naway, Valentine looked sulky, and Irene--always ready for tears--pulled\\nout her pocket-handkerchief.\\n\\n\"Who has drawn this picture on the blackboard?\" continued Miss Pitman.\\n\\n\"Hope--Hope did it! It wasn\\'t any of us!\" snivelled Irene, trying to\\nthrust the brunt of the affair on to her friend\\'s shoulders.\\n\\nMiss Pitman gave Hope a scathing glance, under which the girl quailed.\\n\\n\"An extremely clever way of showing her talent for drawing, no doubt,\"\\nremarked the mistress sarcastically. \"I shall be obliged if someone will\\nclean the board.\"\\n\\nSeveral officious hands at once clutched the duster and erased the\\noffending portrait. Miss Pitman walked to her desk, closed the lid,\\nlocked it, and put the key in her pocket.\\n\\n\"It is superfluous to tell you what I think of you,\" she said. \"Miss\\nTempest will have to hear about this.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Hope\\'s done for with Miss Pitman, at any rate,\" said Bertha\\nWarren to Addie Parker, when the outraged mistress had taken her\\ndeparture, and the four sinners had fled downstairs.\\n\\n\"Yes, there\\'ll be no more favouring now--and a good thing, too! It was\\ntime Miss Pitman\\'s eyes were opened. Will she really tell Miss Tempest?\"\\n\\n\"Serve them right if she does. I\\'m waiting for developments.\"\\n\\nThere was not long to wait. At two o\\'clock, Hope, Blanche, Irene, and\\nValentine received a summons to the study, and after a ten minutes\\'\\ninterview with the head mistress came away with red eyes.\\n\\n\"Have you heard the news?\" said Noëlle Kennedy presently. \"There\\'s been\\na most tremendous storm--a regular blizzard--in the study. Miss Tempest\\nhas been ultra-tempestuous, and Hope and the others have come out just\\nwrecks.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" enquired some of the girls who had not heard of the\\noccurrence in the classroom.\\n\\n\"Hope found Miss Pitman\\'s desk unlocked, and she and Irene and Val and\\nBlanche were calmly turning over the contents when Pittie popped into\\nthe room and caught them. Then the squalls began. They had to report\\nthemselves in the study, and it turned out that there was something else\\nagainst Hope and Blanche. I don\\'t know who gave them away, but somebody\\nhad been telling Miss Tempest that they were at the wedding that day.\\nShe charged them with it, and was simply furious because they hadn\\'t\\nowned up when she asked the class.\"\\n\\n\"I can tell you who told her,\" volunteered Margaret Parker. \"It was\\nProfessor Schenk. He saw them there, and he happened to mention it this\\nmorning.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Miss Tempest was fearfully stern. She said Hope wasn\\'t fit to be\\nWarden, and to represent the Lower School, if she\\'d no more idea of\\nhonour than that. She\\'s taken away the Wardenship from her. She says\\nit\\'s not to be decided by election again--she\\'s going to choose a girl\\nfor herself.\"\\n\\n\"Whom has she chosen?\"\\n\\n\"Grace Russell,\" said Ruth Harmon, who at that moment joined the group.\\n\"It\\'s just been put up on the notice board.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m glad. Grace will make a good Warden.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, there\\'s something solid about Grace. She never lets herself be\\ncarried away.\"\\n\\n\"Hope will be crestfallen.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind--it will do Hope Lawson good to find she\\'s not the most\\nimportant person in the Form.\"\\n\\n\"I say,\" interposed Noëlle, \"isn\\'t this a good opportunity to put in a\\nword for Dorothy? She owned up when Hope didn\\'t, so Miss Tempest ought\\nto remember that. Let us strike while the iron is hot, and go to the\\nstudy now.\"\\n\\n\"Right you are! Where are Mavie and Doris? I\\'m sure they\\'ll come too.\"\\n\\nDorothy\\'s champions walked boldly into the study, and put their case so\\nsuccessfully to Miss Tempest that she condescended to consider it.\\nPerhaps, as Noëlle suspected, she thought she had given too severe a\\npunishment, and was ready to remit it. In the end, she consented to\\nforgive, not only Dorothy, but her companions in misfortune also,\\ngranting all six permission to enter the gymnasium again.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a complete turning of the tables,\" said Ruth, as the girls\\nreturned triumphantly from their mission. \"Dorothy\\'s free, and Hope and\\nBlanche will have to stay in the classroom and do their share of\\npenance.\"\\n\\n\"Then they\\'ll be out of rehearsals.\"\\n\\n\"Of course they will.\"\\n\\n\"And who\\'s to take Becky Sharp?\"\\n\\n\"I vote for Dorothy.\"\\n\\n\"So do I. She deserves it.\"\\n\\n\"Where is she? Let\\'s take her her order of release.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe events of that day had an effect upon the Upper Fourth in more ways\\nthan one. Perhaps Miss Pitman had learnt a lesson, for in future she\\naccepted no presents at all from her pupils, not even flowers, and\\nshowed special favour to nobody. The Form liked her much better now that\\nshe was more impartial.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t stand a teacher who pets one girl and snubs another,\" said\\nRuth. \"It isn\\'t just, and one has a right to expect justice from one\\'s\\nForm mistress.\"\\n\\nGrace Russell was a decided success as Warden. She was not the\\ncleverest girl in the Upper Fourth by any means, but she was one of the\\noldest, and she had a strong sense of duty. She kept the rules\\nscrupulously herself, and discouraged all the shirkings that had come in\\nunder Hope\\'s regime. It was wonderful how rapidly most of the girls\\nresponded to her influence, and how soon the Form began to take a better\\ntone.\\n\\nHope was very quiet and subdued after her deposition, till one day she\\ncaught Dorothy in the dressing-room.\\n\\n\"You\\'re a mean sneak, Dorothy Greenfield!\" she began hotly. \"You\\npromised on your honour you wouldn\\'t tell Miss Tempest we\\'d been at the\\nwedding, and yet you went and did it!\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t!\" declared Dorothy, with equal heat. \"I kept my promise\\nabsolutely. I never told a single soul.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the quarrel?\" said Margaret Parker.\\n\\n\"Why, Dorothy had seen Blanche and me at that wretched wedding--I wish\\nwe\\'d never gone!--and she promised she wouldn\\'t tell, and then she must\\nhave done--I\\'m certain it was she!\"\\n\\n\"It was Professor Schenk who told Miss Tempest,\" replied Margaret. \"I\\nknow, because Beatrice Schenk said so. Do you mean to say you let\\nDorothy own up about that business, and then expected her to keep quiet\\nabout your share of it? It\\'s you who are the sneak. Dorothy tell,\\nindeed! We know her better than that. She flies into rages, but she\\'d\\nscorn to get anybody into trouble at head-quarters. I think she\\'s been a\\ntrump.\"\\n\\nThe feeling of the Form at present was decidedly in Dorothy\\'s favour.\\nSchoolgirl opinion veers round quickly, and a companion who is unpopular\\none week may be a heroine the next. Margaret Parker was so indignant at\\nHope\\'s conduct that she published abroad the story of the promise, and\\nthe general verdict was that Dorothy had shown up very well in the\\naffair.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe I\\'d have kept such a secret and let Hope get off\\nscot-free,\" said Ruth Harmon, \"especially when she was being so rude;\\nbut I\\'m not quixotic, so that makes the difference.\"\\n\\nAfter this the rehearsals in the gymnasium went on briskly. It was\\ngrowing near Christmas, and there was still much to be done to perfect\\nthe performance. Dorothy threw herself with enthusiasm into the part of\\nBecky Sharp; she did it to the life, and defied Miss Pinkerton with\\nspecial zeal.\\n\\n\"She does it almost too well. I wish Miss Tempest could see her!\"\\nlaughed Alison.\\n\\n\"She\\'s going to,\" said Mavie. \"She sent a message to say she\\'d like to\\ncome, and bring some of the mistresses.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Oh! Oh!\" exclaimed the girls.\\n\\nThe little play had only been intended to be acted before a select\\ncircle of day boarders, so the performers felt quite nervous at the\\nidea of numbering Miss Tempest and the mistresses among their audience.\\nIt was to be given at two o\\'clock on the last Tuesday before breaking-up\\nday. It was not possible to make many preparations in the way of\\nscenery, but the girls did their best in respect of costumes. Alison\\ncoaxed two silk dresses and several other properties from her mother,\\nnot to speak of the gorgeous robes in the chest which she brought,\\nthough it was decided after all not to have tableaux. Poor Alison, still\\nfeeling sore about the invitation she had not been allowed to ratify,\\nwas determined to lend Dorothy the best pieces of her theatrical\\nwardrobe, and pressed the handsomest things she possessed upon her. She\\nwas amply satisfied with the result when she saw her friend attired, as\\nBecky, in a green silk dress and sandalled slippers.\\n\\n\"You\\'re just like the illustrations to our _Vanity Fair_. That little\\nmuslin apron\\'s sweet!\" she exclaimed.\\n\\nWhen the afternoon arrived, not only Miss Tempest and five mistresses,\\nbut several members of the Sixth Form took their places on the benches\\nset ready for them.\\n\\n\"Mary Galloway\\'s come! Aren\\'t you nervous, Dorothy?\" whispered Ruth,\\ngreatly excited, for Mary was the president of the College Dramatic\\nUnion, and a critic of matters theatrical.\\n\\nDorothy had got to a stage beyond nervousness. She felt as if she were\\ngoing to execution.\\n\\n\"I expect I shall spoil the whole thing, but it can\\'t be helped,\" she\\nreplied resignedly. With the first sentences, however, her courage\\nreturned, and she \"played up\" splendidly. Her representation of Becky\\nwas so spirited that teachers and elder girls applauded loudly.\\n\\n\"Very good indeed,\" commented Miss Tempest, when the act was over. \"I\\nhad no idea you could all do so well.\"\\n\\n\"I should like a word with Becky Sharp,\" said Mary Galloway, slipping\\nbehind the scenes and drawing that heroine aside. Dorothy returned from\\nthe whispered conference with shining eyes.\\n\\n\"What is it? You\\'re looking radiant!\" said Alison.\\n\\n\"I may well be! Mary Galloway\\'s going to propose me as a member of the\\nCollege Dramatic Union!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nMartha Remembers\\n\\n\\nFor Dorothy the Christmas holidays passed quietly and most uneventfully.\\nShe and Aunt Barbara saw little of the outside world. It had certainly\\ncost Dorothy several pangs to hear the girls at the College discussing\\nthe many invitations they had received and the dances they expected to\\nattend, and to feel that a visit to the vicarage was all the festivity\\nthat would be likely to come her way. There were no parties or\\npantomimes included in her holiday programme. Aunt Barbara had had many\\nexpenses lately, and her narrow income was stretched to its fullest\\nextent to pay school fees and the price of the contract ticket.\\n\\n\"It\\'s hateful to be poor,\" thought Dorothy. \"I want pretty dresses and\\nparties like other girls;\" and she went home with the old wrinkle\\nbetween her brows, and a little droop at the corners of her mouth.\\n\\nIf Aunt Barbara noticed these and divined the cause, she made no\\ncomment; she did not remind Dorothy of how much she had given up on her\\nbehalf, or of what real sacrifice it entailed to send her to Avondale.\\nShe took the opportunity, however, one day to urge her to work her\\nhardest at school.\\n\\n\"You may have to earn your own living some time, child,\" she said. \"If\\nanything happens to me, my small pension goes back to the owner of the\\nSherbourne estate. I shall be able to leave you nothing. A good\\neducation is the only thing I can give you, so you must try to make the\\nmost of it.\"\\n\\n\"Shall I have to be a teacher?\" asked Dorothy blankly.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. It will depend on what I can have you trained for,\"\\nreplied Miss Sherbourne.\\n\\nShe was hurt sometimes by Dorothy\\'s manner; the girl seemed\\ndissatisfied, though she was evidently making an effort to hide the\\nfact.\\n\\n\"It\\'s hard for her to mix at school with girls who have so many more\\nadvantages,\" thought Aunt Barbara. \"Was I wise to send her to Avondale,\\nI wonder? Is it having the effect of making her discontented? It\\'s only\\nlately she\\'s grown like this--she was never so before.\"\\n\\nDiscontented exactly described Dorothy\\'s state of mind. She considered\\nthat Fate had used her unkindly. The prospect of gaining her own living\\nwas extremely distasteful to her. She hated the idea of becoming a\\nteacher, and no other work seemed any more congenial.\\n\\n\"I\\'d always looked forward to enjoying myself when I was grown up,\" she\\nthought bitterly, \"and now it will be nothing but slave.\"\\n\\nAt present Dorothy was viewing life entirely from her own standpoint,\\nand was suffering from an attack of that peculiar complaint called\\n\"self-itis\". She was aggrieved that the world had not given her more,\\nand it never struck her to think of what she might give to the world. It\\nseemed as if she could no longer enjoy all the little simple occupations\\nin which she had been accustomed to take so much pleasure--she was tired\\nof her stamps and postcards, bookbinding and clay modelling had lost\\ntheir attraction, and she was apathetic on the subject of fancy work.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what\\'s come over you,\" declared Martha. \"You just idle\\nabout the house doing nothing at all. Why can\\'t you take your knitting,\\nor a bit of crochet in your fingers?\"\\n\\n\"Simply because I don\\'t want to. I wish you\\'d leave me alone, Martha!\"\\nreplied Dorothy irritably.\\n\\nShe resented the old servant\\'s interference, for Martha was less patient\\nand forbearing than Aunt Barbara, and hinted pretty plainly sometimes\\nwhat she thought of her nursling.\\n\\nSo the holidays passed by--dreary ones for Dorothy, who spent whole\\nlistless evenings staring at the fire; and drearier still for Aunt\\nBarbara, who made many efforts to interest the girl, and, failing\\nutterly, went about with a new sadness in her eyes and a fresh grief in\\nher heart that she would not have confessed to anyone.\\n\\nEverybody at Holly Cottage was glad when the term began again.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t hold with holidays,\" grumbled Martha. \"Give young folks plenty\\nof work, say I, and they\\'re much better than mooning about with naught\\nto do. Dorothy\\'s a different girl when she\\'s got her lessons to keep her\\nbusy.\"\\n\\nTo do Dorothy justice, she certainly worked her hardest at the College,\\nthough the prospect of becoming a teacher did not strike her as an\\ninspiring goal for her efforts. She put the idea away from her as much\\nas possible, but every now and then it returned like a bad nightmare.\\n\\n\"I should hate to be Miss Pitman,\" she remarked one day at school. \"It\\nmust be odious to be a mistress.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so?\" replied Grace Russell. \"Why, I\\'d love it! I mean to\\ngo in for teaching myself some time.\"\\n\\n\"But will you have to earn your own living? I thought your father was\\nwell off,\" objected Dorothy.\\n\\n\"That\\'s no reason why I shouldn\\'t be of some use in the world,\" returned\\nGrace. \"Teaching is a splendid profession if one does it thoroughly. I\\nhave a cousin who\\'s a class mistress at a big school near London, and\\nshe\\'s so happy--her girls just adore her. It must be an immense\\nsatisfaction to feel one\\'s doing some real work, and not being a mere\\ndrone in the hive.\"\\n\\nThis was a new notion to Dorothy, and though she could not quite digest\\nit at first, she turned it over in her mind. She was astonished that\\nGrace, who had a beautiful home, could wish to take up work.\\n\\n\"She\\'d make a far better teacher, though, than Miss Pitman,\" she\\nthought. \"I wonder why? It\\'s something about Grace that makes one\\nfeel--well, that she\\'s always doing things from a motive right above\\nherself.\"\\n\\nDorothy found this an interesting term at the College. As a recruit of\\nthe Dramatic Union, she attended rehearsals and was given a minor part\\nin a play that the members were acting, just for practice. It was an\\nhonour to be included in the \"Dramatic\", for its numbers were limited,\\nand it was mostly made up of girls from the Upper School. Her bright\\nrendering of her small part won her notice among the monitresses.\\n\\n\"Dorothy Greenfield is decidedly taking,\" said Mary Galloway. \"She\\'s as\\nsharp as a needle. I believe I like her.\"\\n\\n\"Um--yes--a little too cheeky for my taste,\" replied Alice Edwards.\\n\"What\\'s the matter with her at present is that she thinks the world is\\nlimited to Dorothy Greenfield.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve hit the mark exactly,\" returned Mary.\\n\\nAbout the end of January Miss Tempest introduced a new feature at the\\nCollege. This was a Guild of First Aid and Field Ambulance, and, though\\nit was not incorporated with any special organization, it was drawn up\\nsomewhat on the same lines as the Girl Guides. The main object was\\ncharacter training, as developed through work for others. Every member\\nof the Guild was pledged to Chivalry, Patriotism, Self-reliance, and\\nHelpfulness; and her aim was to acquire knowledge to make her of\\nservice, not only to herself, but to the community. Membership was not\\nobligatory, but the scheme was so well received that more than half the\\nschool joined, Dorothy and Alison being among the number.\\n\\n\"I had to coax Mother tremendously,\" said Alison. \"At first she said no.\\nYou see, she thought it was something like the Boy Scouts, and she said\\nshe couldn\\'t have me careering about the country on Saturday\\nafternoons--she didn\\'t approve of it for girls.\"\\n\\n\"But we aren\\'t to go out scouting.\"\\n\\n\"No; I explained that, and then she gave way. She says she\\'s not sure\\nwhether she\\'ll let me go to the Field Ambulance meetings, though; she\\'s\\nafraid I\\'ll catch cold. But I didn\\'t argue about that; I was glad enough\\nto persuade her to say yes on any terms.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll have the ambulance work at school.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and perhaps I may go to at least one camp, if the weather\\'s fine.\"\\n\\nThe Avondale Guild of Help, as it was called, though it began primarily\\nwith ambulance, took a wide scope for its work.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want you to think it is only practising bandaging and having\\npicnics in the country,\" said Miss Tempest, in her first address to the\\nmembers. \"What is needed is the principle of learning to give willing\\naid to others, and wishing to be of service. In Japan, when a child is\\nborn, a paper sign of a doll or a fish is put up outside the house, to\\nsignify whether the baby is a girl or a boy--the boy being destined to\\nswim against the stream and make his own way in the world, and the girl\\nbeing a doll to be played with. This idea does not meet our present-day\\nstandards in England. We do not want our girls to grow up dolls, but\\nhelpful comrades and worthy citizens of the Empire. It is terrible to me\\nto think of girls, after their schooldays are over, leading aimless,\\nidle, profitless lives, when there is plenty of good work waiting to be\\ndone in the world. \\'To whom much is committed, of the same shall much be\\nrequired\\', and the education you receive here should be a trust to hand\\non to others who have not had your advantages. There is nobody who\\ncannot make some little corner of the world better by her presence, and\\nbe of use to her poorer neighbours, and I hope the Guild may lead to\\nmany other schemes. For the present, I want every member to promise to\\nmake one garment a year as her contribution to our charity basket. The\\nclothes will be sent to the Ragged School Mission in the town, and\\ndistributed to those who badly need them.\"\\n\\nEach member of the Guild signed her name on a scroll, pledged herself to\\nobserve the rules, and received the badge, a little shield bearing the\\nmotto: \"As one that serveth\".\\n\\n\"I feel almost like a Crusader!\" laughed Dorothy, as she pinned on her\\nbadge.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a part of the greatest of all crusades,\" said Grace Russell\\ngravely.\\n\\nEverybody was delighted with the ambulance classes. They were considered\\nthe utmost fun, and the girls looked forward to them from week to week.\\nThey were held in the gymnasium, the members practising upon one\\nanother. Any stranger suddenly entering the room would have been amazed\\nto see rows of girls lying prostrate on the floor, while amateur nurses\\nknelt by their sides, placing their legs in splints contrived out of\\nhockey sticks, binding up their jaws, or lifting them tenderly and\\ncarrying them on improvised stretchers with a swinging \"step both\\ntogether\" motion. It was amusing when at a certain signal the nurses and\\npatients changed places; by an apparent miracle the latter kicked away\\ntheir splints, tore off their bandages, and set to work with enthusiasm\\nto apply treatment to the imaginary injuries of their quondam\\nattendants.\\n\\nOf course, there were many laughable mistakes. Ruth Harmon got mixed one\\nday in the diagnosis, and insisted upon turning a rebellious patient\\nupon her face.\\n\\n\"What are you doing? You\\'re rolling me over like a log!\" protested\\nJoyce. \"Do stop!\"\\n\\n\"No, I shan\\'t. Let me pull out your tongue. It\\'s to get the water from\\nyour mouth,\" insisted Ruth. \"It\\'s no use working your arms when your air\\npassages are choked.\"\\n\\n\"But I wasn\\'t drowning! I have a broken leg!\"\\n\\n\"Then why couldn\\'t you tell me so at first? I thought you were one of\\nthose who were supposed to be fished out of the river!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve grown quite clever at pretending fits,\" said Alison. \"I only\\nbargain that they stick my own pocket-handkerchief between my teeth.\"\\n\\n\"My speciality is a sprained ankle,\" said Dorothy. \"I can hold my foot\\nquite limp and let it waggle.\"\\n\\n\"It was you who talked when you had a broken jaw, and that\\'s a sheer\\nimpossibility,\" said Annie Gray.\\n\\n\"Well! Who sneezed when we were trying treatment for bleeding from the\\nnose?\"\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t help that; it was a \\'physical disability\\'.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s our turn to revive fainting. Who\\'ll do an elegant swoon? Alison,\\nwill you?\"\\n\\n\"No, thanks. I don\\'t mind fits, but I hate faints. The burnt feather\\nmakes me cough, and last time you simply soused me with water. I thought\\nI was being drowned.\"\\n\\nAs the term went on and the girls became more adept at first aid, Miss\\nTempest decided to organize a camp drill, and to take them for an\\nafternoon\\'s practice in field work. To Dorothy\\'s delight, a meadow at\\nHurford was chosen as the scene of action.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll be able to come and watch, Auntie,\" she said to Aunt Barbara.\\n\"We\\'re going to do all sorts of exciting things. We\\'re to suppose\\nthere\\'s been a battle, and then we\\'ll come on and help the\\nwounded--carry some of them to transport wagons, and make wind screens\\nfor others, and of course bind them all up first. We\\'re to have a lot of\\nlittle boys from the Orphanage for soldiers--that\\'s why Miss Tempest\\nchose to come to Hurford, because they\\'ve a Boy Scout Corps at the\\nOrphanage, and can lend us some real stretchers and a proper ambulance\\nwagon. I hope I shall get a nice bright boy as patient.\"\\n\\nAfter considerable coaxing, Alison managed to persuade her mother to\\nallow her to take part, if the day proved suitable.\\n\\n\"It\\'s so much warmer now, Mother dearest,\" she pleaded. \"I haven\\'t had a\\ncold for ages; and we shan\\'t be standing still--we shall be busy running\\nabout all the time. It\\'s only from half-past two till four. You might\\ncome and watch.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s my afternoon to help at the Sewing Meeting,\" said Mrs. Clarke. \"I\\ncould hardly miss that while the Deaconess is away.\"\\n\\n\"Then drive over to Hurford and fetch me home. I haven\\'t been out in the\\ntrap for ages--yes, ages! Do, darling Motherkins! I should so enjoy it,\\nand--oh yes, I\\'ll put a Shetland shawl over my mouth, if you like, and\\nyou could bring my thick coat. Will you promise?\"\\n\\n\"It depends on the weather, Birdie,\" replied her mother discreetly.\\n\\nThe afternoon in question turned out mild enough to allay even Mrs.\\nClarke\\'s fears. It was one of those balmy, delicious days in early\\nspring when the earth seems to throb with renewed life, and there is\\nreal warmth in the sunshine. The Guild members had dinner earlier than\\nusual, and caught the two o\\'clock train to Hurford. The field that had\\nbeen engaged as their temporary camp was close to the Orphanage, and\\nthey found all ready for them on their arrival, from the stretchers to\\nthe row of nice little boys in uniform upon whom they were to operate.\\nEverything was strictly business-like. The officers and patrol leaders\\nat once took command, and began to instruct each group of ambulance\\nworkers in the particular duties they were expected to perform. One\\ndetachment started to build a fire (there is a science in the building\\nof fires in the open), a second ran up the Red Cross flag and arranged a\\ntemporary hospital with supplies from the transport wagon, while a third\\nwent out to render first aid to the wounded.\\n\\nThe boys entered thoroughly into the spirit of the affair. A blank\\ncharge was fired, at which signal they all dropped down on the grass as\\n\"injured\".\\n\\nDorothy, who was told off to No. 3 Corps, flew at the sound of the guns,\\nand pounced upon the first prostrate form she came across.\\n\\n\"Are you killed or wounded?\" she enquired breathlessly.\\n\\n\"Wounded, m\\'m,\" replied the boy, with a grin. \"But you can\\'t have me,\\nbecause another lady\\'s got me already. She looks at me and she says:\\n\\'Not movable\\', and she\\'s run to get a spade to dig a \\'ole with.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! To put your hip in, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, m\\'m. They don\\'t bury us unless we\\'re killed.\"\\n\\n\"I should think not!\" exclaimed Dorothy, as she hurried away to find a\\npatient who was still unappropriated.\\n\\n\"Anybody attending to you?\" she asked a solemn, curly-headed little\\nfellow, who lay under the shade of the hedge with arms stretched in a\\ndramatic attitude on either side of him.\\n\\n\"No, miss--shot through the lungs, and leg shattered,\" he replied\\ncomplacently.\\n\\n\"Then it\\'s a case of stop bleeding, bandage, and lift on stretcher. I\\'ll\\nbind you up first, and then call for someone to help to carry you. Can\\nyou raise yourself at all on your arm, or are you helpless? Am I hurting\\nyou?\"\\n\\n\"No, miss--but you do tickle me awful!\"\\n\\n\"Never mind; I\\'ve almost finished. Now your leg. Which is it--right or\\nleft?\"\\n\\n\"Left. But lor\\', if it was really shattered, I\\'d rather you touched\\nt\\'other!\"\\n\\n\"No, you wouldn\\'t. You\\'d be grateful to me for saving your life. I\\'m\\ngoing to whistle for help. Here comes a corporal. Where\\'s my stretcher\\nsling? Now, Marjorie, let us lift him quickly and gently. That was\\nneatly done! We\\'ll have him in hospital in record time.\"\\n\\nEverybody enjoyed the afternoon, the patrols that performed the camp\\ncookery, the first-aid workers, the nursing sisters at the hospital, and\\nthe elect few who were initiated into the elements of signalling.\\n\\nAlison, who had helped to put up a tent, and given imaginary chloroform\\nunder the directions of a supposed army surgeon, was immensely proud of\\nherself, and half-inclined to regard the work of the Red Cross\\nSisterhood as her vocation in life.\\n\\n\"It\\'s ripping!\" she declared. \"I\\'d six of the jolliest boys for\\npatients. One of them offered to faint as many times as I liked, and\\nanother (he was a cunning little scamp) assured me his case required\\nbeef tea immediately it was ready in the camp kitchen. He asked if I\\'d\\nbrought any chocolate. Another was so realistic, he insisted on\\nshrieking every time I touched him, and he groaned till his throat must\\nhave ached. I think ambulance is the best fun going.\"\\n\\n\"We must beseech Miss Tempest to let us have another field day,\" said\\nGrace Russell, who had been helping with the cookery and carrying round\\nwater. \"We each want to practise every part of the work so as to be\\nready for emergencies. It isn\\'t a really easy thing to give a prostrate\\npatient a drink without nearly choking him. One doesn\\'t know all the\\ndifficulties until one tries.\"\\n\\n\"One doesn\\'t, indeed,\" said Ruth Harmon. \"Field work isn\\'t plain\\nsailing. I wish we hadn\\'t to catch the 4.15 train; I should have liked\\nto stay longer. There\\'s the signal to form and march. Aren\\'t you coming,\\nAlison?\"\\n\\n\"No; I\\'m not going by train. My mother promised to drive over for me. I\\nwonder she hasn\\'t arrived.\"\\n\\n\"Will she come by the high road from Latchworth?\" asked Dorothy. \"Then\\nwalk home with Aunt Barbara and me. We shall very likely meet her on the\\nway.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'d love to see where you live!\" exclaimed Alison. \"Is that your\\naunt? She\\'s sweet. I imagined somehow she\\'d be much older than that. I\\nthink she\\'s ever so pretty. I hope Mother\\'ll be late, and that we shall\\nget as far as your house before we meet the trap.\"\\n\\nAlison chattered briskly as they walked along the road; she had a very\\nfriendly disposition, and was much taken with Miss Sherbourne\\'s\\nappearance. She had not been in Hurford before, so she was interested to\\nnotice the fine old church and the picturesque village street.\\n\\n\"It\\'s ever so much prettier than Latchworth,\" she declared. \"I wish our\\nhouse were here instead. Oh, look at that dear little place with the\\nporch all covered with creepers! Is that yours? How lovely! It looks as\\nif it had stepped out of a picture.\"\\n\\n\"Won\\'t you come in, dear, and wait for your mother?\" said Miss\\nSherbourne. \"We can watch for the trap from the window.\"\\n\\n\"May I? I\\'d love to. Oh, Dorothy, while I\\'m here, do show me your\\nstamps! You always promised to bring them to school, but you never have\\ndone it. And I want to look at your clay models too.\"\\n\\n\"Come to my den, then,\" said Dorothy. \"Martha will stand at the gate and\\nstop the trap from passing, won\\'t you, Martha? Now, Alison, we\\'ll go\\nupstairs.\"\\n\\nThe two girls had only a very short time in which to examine Dorothy\\'s\\nvarious possessions. After a few minutes Martha came running up to say\\nthat the trap was waiting.\\n\\n\"And the lady said you were please to come at once,\" she added,\\naddressing Alison.\\n\\n\"Oh, bother,\" exclaimed the latter; \"I haven\\'t seen half yet! I suppose\\nI shall have to go, though. Where\\'s your aunt? I want to say good-bye to\\nher. Oh, there she is at the gate, speaking to Mother!\"\\n\\nMrs. Clarke was not at all pleased to find her daughter awaiting her at\\nHolly Cottage, though she had the good manners to conceal her feelings\\nand speak politely to Miss Sherbourne; so she hustled Alison into the\\ntrap as speedily as possible.\\n\\n\"We\\'re late, Birdie. I couldn\\'t help it--I was delayed at the Sewing\\nMeeting. But we must hurry home now. Here\\'s your shawl, and put this\\ngolf cape on. No, child; you must have it properly round you.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m so hot!\" panted poor Alison, dutifully submitting to the extra\\nwraps.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll be cold enough driving. Have you tucked the rug thoroughly round\\nyour knees? Then say good-bye.\"\\n\\n\"Good-bye! Good-bye! I hadn\\'t half enough time,\" cried Alison, trying to\\nwave a hand, in spite of the encumbrance of the golf cape. \"I\\'d like to\\ncome again and----\" But here her mother whipped up the pony so smartly\\nthat the rest of the sentence was lost in the grating of wheels.\\n\\n\"So that is Mrs. Clarke,\" said Aunt Barbara, as she entered the cottage\\nagain. \"She looks nice, though I wish she had allowed Alison to stay for\\na few minutes longer. It\\'s a funny thing, but somehow her face seems so\\nfamiliar to me. I wonder if I can possibly have met her before?\"\\n\\n\"Have you seen her in Coleminster?\" suggested Dorothy.\\n\\n\"No; the remembrance seems to be much farther back than that. I should\\nsay it was a long time ago.\"\\n\\n\"So it was--nearly fourteen years,\" volunteered Martha, who was laying\\nthe tea table. \"I remembered her fast enough. I knew her the moment I\\nset my eyes on her.\"\\n\\nMartha had the privilege of long service, and was accustomed to speak\\nher mind and offer advice to her mistress on many occasions. If she was\\nblunt and abrupt in her manners, she was a very faithful soul, and her\\nnorth-country brains were shrewd and keen. She was an authority in the\\nlittle household on many points, and her remarks were never ignored.\\n\\n\"Why, Martha, I always say you\\'ve a better memory than I have,\" returned\\nMiss Sherbourne. \"Where did we know her, then?\"\\n\\n\"We didn\\'t know her,\" said Martha, pausing and looking at Dorothy. \"The\\nbairn\\'s been told about it now, so I suppose I can speak before her?\\nWell, that lady in the trap to-day is the same one that came to the inn\\nat Greenfield Junction, and was so upset at sight of the child.\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure, Martha?\" exclaimed Miss Barbara.\\n\\n\"Certain; I never forget a face. I\\'d take my oath before a judge and\\njury.\"\\n\\n\"She did not remember us.\"\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t she? I wouldn\\'t swear to that. You\\'ve not changed so much but\\nthat anyone would recognize you. It\\'s my opinion she knew us both, and\\nthat was the reason she was in such a precious hurry to get away.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\nAlison\\'s Uncle\\n\\n\\nNot very long after the events narrated in the last chapter, Alison\\nentered the train one morning in quite a state of excitement, and could\\nscarcely wait to greet Dorothy before she began to pour out her news.\\n\\n\"Mother had a letter yesterday by the afternoon post. It was from Uncle\\nDavid, and he\\'s actually on his way home to England. He\\'s not going back\\nto India at all; he wants to settle down near Latchworth. He\\'ll get here\\nbefore Easter, and he\\'s coming straight to stay with us. Isn\\'t it\\nlovely?\"\\n\\n\"Are you fond of him?\" enquired Dorothy.\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s just ripping! He\\'s so jolly, you know, always having jokes and\\nfun with me. He\\'s the only uncle I possess, so of course I make the most\\nof him; but he\\'s as good as a dozen.\"\\n\\n\"And I don\\'t possess even one,\" thought Dorothy. \"Have you any cousins?\"\\nshe added aloud.\\n\\n\"Only seconds and thirds once removed. They\\'re so distant, I can\\nscarcely count them as relations. My one first cousin died when she was\\na baby, and Aunt Madeleine died too--out in India--so poor Uncle David\\nhas been alone ever since. But he\\'s always fearfully busy; he goes about\\nsuperintending railways and building bridges. He has a whole army of\\ncoolies under him sometimes, and they have to take the lines through\\njungles where there are tigers, and snakes, and things. He writes us the\\nmost tremendously interesting letters. Oh, I\\'m just longing to hear all\\nhis stories! When I can get him in the right mood and he starts, he\\nyarns on for hours, and it\\'s so fascinating, I never want him to stop.\"\\n\\n\"So he is to stay at your house?\"\\n\\n\"Rather! We\\'d be fearfully cross with him if he didn\\'t. He\\'s coming to\\nus first, and then he and Mother and I are all going away somewhere for\\nthe Easter holidays. It will be such fun! I wish the time would fly\\nquicker.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s only a fortnight to the end of the term now,\" said Dorothy.\\n\\n\"I know, but a fortnight is fourteen days, my dear. Mother says Uncle\\nDavid will probably arrive at the end of next week, though; she thinks\\nhe may come overland from Marseilles. She wants to arrange to go away on\\nthe Wednesday before Easter at latest. I don\\'t expect I shall come to\\nschool for the last day--perhaps not in the last week at all. Mother\\ncan\\'t bear travelling when the trains are crowded, so we may start on\\nthe Monday or Tuesday.\"\\n\\n\"What place are you going to?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. We\\'re leaving that for Uncle David to decide.\"\\n\\nIt must be delightful, thought Dorothy, to have the anticipation of such\\na pleasant holiday. Alison was much to be envied, not only for the\\npossession of so desirable an uncle, but because he seemed disposed to\\nspend his time in the company of his niece, and to entertain her with\\ntales of adventure.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t suppose I shall see him,\" she said to herself. \"They won\\'t ask\\nme to Lindenlea; but I should like to hear some of the stories about\\nIndia. Well, luck never comes my way. Nobody\\'s going to take me away\\nfrom home this Easter.\"\\n\\nSometimes when we are railing our hardest at Fate, and calling her by\\nopprobrious names, she astonishes us by twisting round her mystic wheel\\nand sending us an unwonted piece of good fortune. Dorothy had often\\nbemoaned the fact that nobody ever asked her away; yet only a week\\nafterwards she received an invitation, and that from a most unexpected\\nquarter. She had always been rather a favourite with Dr. Longton, who\\nhad attended her in measles, bronchitis, and the few other ailments in\\nwhich she had indulged; and also with Mrs. Longton, a kind-hearted,\\nelderly lady, whose daughters were all married and living in\\nColeminster. On the Saturday before Easter Mrs. Longton called on Miss\\nSherbourne, mentioned that she and the doctor were going to the Dales\\nfor a little holiday, and asked if Dorothy might be allowed to accompany\\nthem.\\n\\n\"We had arranged to take my niece,\" she explained, \"but her mother is\\nunwell, and she cannot leave home at present. We had engaged a bedroom\\nfor her at the Hydro., so we shall be delighted if Dorothy will occupy\\nit instead. We are both fond of young people, and it will be a pleasure\\nto have her with us. Would you care to come, my dear?\"\\n\\nDorothy\\'s face was such a beaming advertisement of joy that her instant\\nacquiescence seemed superfluous. Aunt Barbara readily agreed, and in a\\nfew minutes the whole plan was discussed and fixed.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t it too lovely!\" cried Dorothy, exulting over her invitation when\\nMrs. Longton had gone. \"I\\'ve never in my life stayed at a hydro. And to\\ngo to Clevedale, too! I suppose it\\'s splendid. Bertha Warren was at\\nRingborough last summer, and she raved over it. Auntie, don\\'t you think\\nfor once I\\'m in luck\\'s way? I believe it\\'s because I bought a swastika\\nat the bazaar, and have worn it ever since, though you told me I was\\nsilly to spend my sixpence on it.\"\\n\\nAunt Barbara laughed.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe in charms. I remember I found a horseshoe on the very\\nday I sprained my ankle, long ago, and the biggest cheque I ever\\nreceived came immediately after I had spilt a whole salt-cellar full of\\nsalt. But I certainly agree that you\\'re a lucky girl. It\\'s extremely\\nkind of the Longtons to take you.\"\\n\\n\"And we\\'re starting next Thursday! Hip, hip, hooray!\" sang Dorothy,\\nhopping into the kitchen to tell Martha her good news.\\n\\nIt was really a very great event for Dorothy to go from home. Every\\ndetail of her preparations and packing was interesting to her. It was\\ndelightful to be able to take out the new nightdress-case, and the best\\nbrush and comb, which had been lying for so long a time in her bottom\\ndrawer, waiting for an occasion such as this; to put fresh notepaper in\\nher writing-case, and to replenish the sewing materials in her blue silk\\n\"housewife\". There were great debates over her clothing, for she was\\nstill growing at such express speed that any garments which had been put\\naway were hopelessly short, particularly the white dress that was to do\\nduty for evening wear.\\n\\n\"I believe it has shrunk!\" she exclaimed ruefully.\\n\\n\"No; it\\'s you who have shot up so fast. I wish the clothes grew with\\nyou! I must try if I can lengthen it.\"\\n\\nMiss Sherbourne had clever fingers, and she contrived to make the\\nnecessary alterations so skilfully that nobody would have detected them;\\nand Dorothy declared that, far from being spoilt, the dress was\\nimproved.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve bought you some new hair ribbons, and you can wear your chain of\\ngreen Venetian beads,\" said Aunt Barbara. \"Where are your Prayer Book\\nand hymn-book? And your stockings? Bring them here with the other\\nthings; we\\'ll pack in my bedroom.\"\\n\\nThe College broke up for the holidays on the Wednesday before Easter.\\nAlison did not appear at school all that week, so Dorothy supposed that\\nthe uncle must have arrived, and that they had gone from home.\\n\\n\"Alison doesn\\'t know I\\'m having a jaunt too,\" she thought. \"We shall be\\nable to compare notes when we meet again.\"\\n\\nOn the longed-for Thursday Dorothy, feeling very important and grown-up,\\nmet Dr. and Mrs. Longton at the station, and found herself \"off and\\naway\". The trains were crowded and late, but she enjoyed the journey\\nnevertheless. She had seen so little of the world that it was a delight\\nto her to watch the landscape from the carriage windows; and the bustle\\nof the busy station where they changed amused her, however it might\\ndistract Dr. Longton, who was anxious about the luggage. Their\\ndestination was Ringborough, a beautiful spot in Clevedale much\\ncelebrated for its bracing air and its splendid mountain views. The\\nhydropathic establishment where they were to stay was situated on a\\npine-clad hillside, and its extensive grounds sloped to a turbulent\\nnorthern river that swirled along, brown with peat from the moors.\\n\\nDr. Longton, who was an enthusiastic angler, and had come armed with a\\nvariety of fishing tackle, looked at the condition of the water with a\\ncritical eye as he passed.\\n\\n\"Well, when I can\\'t fish I can golf,\" he remarked. \"The links here are\\namong the best in the kingdom. Dorothy, do you feel inclined to act\\ncaddy?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d rather carry your baskets of fish,\" laughed Dorothy.\\n\\n\"You little impudence! Do you mean to hint that my catches will prove\\nsuch a light weight? Just wait and see. I\\'ll make you earn your salt,\\nyoung lady. Perhaps you\\'ll be staggering under a creel like a Newhaven\\nfishwife before you return. Here we are at last. Now, I hope they\\'ve\\nreally kept the rooms I asked for. I stipulated for a south aspect.\"\\n\\nThe hydropathic, it appeared, was very full, and the doctor, greatly to\\nhis dissatisfaction, was not able to have the particular accommodation\\nfor which he had written.\\n\\n\"We must put up with what we can get, I suppose,\" he grunted. \"At this\\nseason everybody swarms out of town for a breath of mountain air and a\\ntry at the trout.\"\\n\\nDorothy, at any rate, was not disposed to grumble at the little bedroom\\nwhich fell to her share, though it was on the top story. She liked going\\nup and down in the lift, and her window looked directly out on to the\\nwoods at the back. There was a delicious smell of pines in the air, and\\nwhen she leaned out she could catch a glimpse, round the corner, of a\\npiece of brown river. In the highest spirits she unpacked and changed\\nher dress, and Mrs. Longton came to take her downstairs.\\n\\nThe ways of a hydropathic were unknown to Dorothy; it seemed new and\\nstrange to her to enter the large public drawing-room, full of people\\nwaiting for the dinner gong to sound. She looked round with keen\\ninterest at the other visitors. A large party of gentlemen stood near\\nthe piano, discussing fishing prospects; some golfers, collected round\\nthe fire, were comparing notes and relating experiences; a few of the\\nladies were busy with fancy work, and some were reading. Standing by the\\nbookcase, turning over the volumes, was a familiar little figure with a\\nround, rosy face.\\n\\n\"By all that\\'s marvellous, it\\'s Alison!\" gasped Dorothy.\\n\\nThe recognition between the two girls was a mutual astonishment. Alison\\nrushed to welcome her friend in great excitement.\\n\\n\"Dorothy, is it really you? Oh, how delightful! Mother, Dorothy\\'s\\nactually staying here! Uncle David, this is my very greatest friend! Oh,\\nwhat a perfectly lovely surprise! When did you come? We\\'ve been here\\nsince Monday.\"\\n\\nMrs. Clarke greeted Dorothy coldly, but the pleasant-faced,\\nbrown-bearded gentleman addressed as Uncle David smiled as he shook\\nhands.\\n\\n\"So this is your school chum, Birdie? Well, it\\'s a piece of luck for you\\nthat she\\'s turned up here. There\\'ll be high jinks now, I expect.\"\\n\\n\"Rather!\" declared Alison, with a beaming look. \"It\\'s the one thing that\\nwill make the holiday complete.\"\\n\\nThough Mrs. Clarke might not share her daughter\\'s enthusiasm at the\\nmeeting, she found it impossible to prevent the intimacy between the two\\ngirls. She made a struggle at first to keep them apart, but Alison had\\nbeen spoilt too long not to know how to wheedle her mother and get her\\nown way.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t be rude to Dorothy,\" she pleaded. \"It will seem so\\nextraordinary if I mayn\\'t speak to her.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t forbid you to speak to her, only there is no need for you to\\nspend your whole time together. I don\\'t wish you to be on such familiar\\nterms,\" replied Mrs. Clarke.\\n\\n\"Nonsense, Cecily!\" put in Uncle David, interfering on behalf of his\\nniece. \"You\\'re quite absurd over Birdie. The poor child must have some\\nyoung friends; you can\\'t expect her to be content with us middle-aged\\npeople. I like this Dorothy What\\'s-her-name. She has a bright, taking\\nlittle face. It can\\'t possibly do Birdie any harm to associate with her.\\nYou can\\'t bring up the girl in cotton wool. You coddle her enough on the\\nsubject of health, so at least let her enjoy herself in other ways. I\\'m\\ngoing fishing to-morrow with Dr. Longton--he\\'s a bluff old Yorkshireman,\\nbut he\\'s capital company, and he\\'s a member of the North Riding Anglers\\'\\nClub. He\\'s promised to give me some hints.\"\\n\\nWith her uncle\\'s influence on her side, Alison felt an official seal had\\nbeen placed on her friendship; and as Mrs. Longton was pleased for\\nDorothy to have found a companion, the two girls were much together.\\nRingborough Hydropathic was a favourite resort for Coleminster people,\\nand two other girls from the College happened to be staying there with\\ntheir families--Hope Lawson and Gabrielle Helm, who was in the Lower\\nFifth. Hope did not look particularly pleased to meet her classmates;\\nshe gave them each a cool little nod, and took no further notice of\\nthem. She was much occupied with her own set of friends, and did not\\nseem disposed to trouble herself with her schoolfellows; nor were they\\nanxious to push themselves under her notice. Gabrielle Helm, on the\\ncontrary, claimed acquaintance with Dorothy and Alison, and introduced\\nher brothers, Percy and Eric, who attended the Coleminster Boys\\'\\nCollege. The young people were keen on golf, and from them Dorothy\\nreceived her first lessons on the links, laughing very much over her\\nmistakes and false strokes, and enjoying every moment of the time. She\\nhad never spent such holidays, or dreamed that they were even possible;\\nand the days did not seem half or a quarter long enough for all the\\ndelightful things there were to do in them.\\n\\n\"It was good of you to bring me,\" she said sometimes to Mrs. Longton.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a pleasure to see your bright face, my dear,\" replied her kind\\nchaperon. \"You\\'re so rosy, your aunt will hardly know you when you\\nreturn.\"\\n\\n\"Dorothy is growing quite pretty,\" said Gabrielle Helm to Alison. \"I\\nused to think her rather a scrawny-looking girl, but she\\'s suddenly\\ndeveloped into almost a beauty. Percy said last night he thought her\\nripping, and he\\'s a fearful old \\'hard-to-please\\'.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Alison contemplatively, \"Dorothy has changed. Of course, her\\neyes were always lovely, but her face has filled out lately, and she\\ndoes her hair more becomingly. That\\'s made a difference. And that blue\\ndress suits her. I think she\\'s prettier now than Hope Lawson.\"\\n\\n\"Hope wouldn\\'t allow that.\"\\n\\n\"Rather not!\" laughed Alison.\\n\\nDorothy was indeed having \"the time of her life\", and very great\\nhappiness is often an aid to good looks. Though she found Mrs. Clarke\\nrather chilly and distant, she liked Alison\\'s Uncle David immensely.\\nSometimes the two girls would accompany him and the doctor on a fishing\\nexpedition, or a walk through the pine woods, where he proved the\\npleasantest and most humorous of companions; or, better still, they\\nwould catch him in the half-hour before dinner, decoy him into one of\\nthe small sitting-rooms generally empty at that time in the evening, and\\nthen cajole him into telling some of his experiences in the jungle. To\\nDorothy these Indian stories were thrilling; she was never tired of\\nhearing about tigers and elephants, ruined temples, fakirs, coolies, and\\nmidnight adventures.\\n\\n\"Of course, Uncle David draws the long bow considerably,\" laughed\\nAlison. \"He expects one to take ten per cent discount off all his\\ntraveller\\'s yarns. But they\\'re very fascinating, even if they\\'re not\\ntrue! He likes you, because you\\'re a good listener. Dorothy, what shall\\nwe do without you when the holiday\\'s over?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t speak of it! I\\'m living in the present from hour to hour,\"\\ndeclared Dorothy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\nThe Subterranean Cavern\\n\\n\\nThe Ringborough Hydropathic was not only celebrated for fishing and\\ngolf--the neighbourhood itself held many attractions. The mountains\\nround, grim stony ridges, contained curiosities of nature such as are\\nonly found in a limestone district. There were wonderful subterranean\\ncaverns, full of stalactites and stalagmites; underground lakes and\\nrivers, and mysterious \"potholes\" leading no one knew whither.\\n\\n\"We ought to make an excursion to Lingham Cave,\" said Percy Helm one\\nday. \"It\\'s one of the local sights, and it seems a pity to miss it.\\nCouldn\\'t we arrange to go altogether in a big party? To-morrow would be\\na good opportunity.\"\\n\\nWhen to-morrow came, none of the elders seemed disposed to fall in with\\nPercy\\'s plans. Dr. Longton and Mr. Clarke were bent on fishing, Mrs.\\nLongton was tired and preferred to stay in the garden, and Mr. and Mrs.\\nHelm wished to play golf. Mrs. Clarke would not hear of Alison\\'s going\\non such an expedition.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been before to Lingham,\" she said, \"and I know from experience how\\ndamp and cold it is inside the cave. You were coughing last night,\\nBirdie, and I don\\'t want to risk your catching a bad cold. You must be\\ncontent to do something quiet to-day.\"\\n\\nDorothy easily obtained Mrs. Longton\\'s consent, so she and the three\\nyoung Helms took packets of lunch and started to walk over the fells to\\nLingham, a distance of about four miles. The weather was still cold, and\\nthe crests of some of the highest hills were tipped with snow. The keen,\\nbracing air felt like a tonic. The four strode along briskly over the\\nshort moorland grass, admiring the rugged gorge whence the river flowed\\nfirst between two sheer walls of limestone, and then through a chasm\\nthat seemed to have been made by the rending asunder of a mountain of\\nrock.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a primeval kind of place,\" said Gabrielle. \"One can understand\\nwhat a terrible upheaval there must have been to split the cliffs and\\ntwist all the strata out of shape. What enormous force it must have\\nneeded! One wonders if any human beings were there when it happened.\"\\n\\n\"If there were, they wouldn\\'t be there long,\" said Percy. \"The smallest\\nof those rocks would be enough to crush an army.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a pity Alison isn\\'t here,\" remarked Dorothy. \"She\\'s rather keen on\\ngeology, and one gets a much better general view of the gorge from here\\nthan from the Hydro.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'m sorry she wasn\\'t allowed to come,\" replied Gabrielle. \"I think\\nMrs. Clarke is fearfully nervous. I\\'m glad Mother doesn\\'t fuss over me\\nto such an extent. Still, it has another side to it--it must be rather\\nnice to be a treasured only child!\"\\n\\n\"Then you should have been born in a different family; you made a bad\\nchoice in ours,\" said Eric.\\n\\n\"How many of you are there altogether?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\\n\"Seven; we\\'ve left the little ones behind.\"\\n\\n\"Only Norma goes to the Coll.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; the other three are nursery children. You don\\'t know what it is to\\nbe eldest daughter. Be thankful you haven\\'t three small nuisances at\\nhome.\"\\n\\n\"I wish I had!\" said Dorothy.\\n\\n\"All right; you may change places with me. I\\'ll hand over the whole set\\nof brothers and sisters, Percy and Eric included.\"\\n\\n\"A happy exchange for us!\" murmured Percy, with a look at Dorothy.\\n\\n\"You horrid boy!\" said Gabrielle.\\n\\n\"I want to know why Percy has brought that coil of rope with him,\"\\nenquired Dorothy. \"I\\'ve been wondering ever since we started.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m quite prepared to satisfy your curiosity. Let us sit down\\nand eat our lunch while I expound; there are some jolly stones here for\\nseats.\"\\n\\nAll four were very ready for lunch, though it was only twelve o\\'clock.\\nThe keen air had given them fine appetites, and the ham sandwiches and\\nchicken drumsticks disappeared quickly, not to speak of the bread and\\ncheese and cakes.\\n\\n\"They don\\'t put up bad lunches at the Hydro.,\" said Percy, aiming his\\nlast chicken bone at a bird that flew overhead.\\n\\n\"What about the rope?\" asked Dorothy again. \"I\\'m still inquisitive.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s an idea of mine. You know, everybody goes to Lingham Cave; it\\'s a\\nregular show place. You pay your shilling, and you\\'re taken round by a\\nguide who tells you where to step, and not to knock your head, and all\\nthat kind of stuff, and prates away about geology and natural\\ncuriosities and the rest of it, as if he\\'d learnt it off like a lesson.\\nWell, instead of going where everybody else goes, I think it would be\\nmuch better fun to explore a place of our own. There\\'s another cave at\\nthe other side of Lingham, on the spur of Whernscar. I saw the entrance\\nto it last Friday, when I walked over with Dr. Shaw. He pointed it out\\nto me, and said very few people had been down it, but it was quite as\\nfine as the other, and had splendid--what do you call those\\nthingumgigs?--oh yes, stalactites, and an underground waterfall.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: A LESSON IN GOLF]\\n\\n\"Is there a guide there?\" asked Eric.\\n\\n\"No; that\\'s the best of it--no shillings to pay, and no bothering\\nlecture. People fight shy of it because it\\'s so out of the way and\\nrather difficult to go down--the passage is narrow, and there\\'s one bad\\nplace. I thought if we had a rope, though, we could manage it easily;\\nand look! I\\'ve brought all these candles and three boxes of matches.\"\\n\\n\"It would be ripping to see an underground waterfall,\" said Eric. \"There\\nisn\\'t one in Lingham Cave.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; we might never get such an opportunity again. Who votes for\\nWhernscar?\"\\n\\n\"I do,\" said Dorothy promptly. The idea of an adventure tempted her. She\\nwas always attracted by the unknown.\\n\\n\"I suppose we should be all right? It will be quite safe, I mean?\"\\nqueried Gabrielle, a little doubtfully.\\n\\n\"Right as a trivet, with a rope and candles,\" replied Percy. \"I expect\\nif this cave were nearer Lingham village it would be more popular than\\nthe other. It\\'s fearfully far from the station, though, which doesn\\'t\\nsuit trippers.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re trippers ourselves if we make a trial trip,\" laughed Eric.\\n\\nAll the four young people were excited at the prospect of exploring a\\nlittle-known cavern without the assistance of a guide. They felt like a\\nband of pioneers in a fresh country, or the discoverers of a new\\ncontinent. None of them in the least realized the risk of the\\nproceeding, and no older person was there to preach wisdom. Percy, who\\nhad been over the fells before, knew the way, and therefore assumed the\\ndirection of the party. Instead of going down to Lingham, they turned up\\nthe hill instead, and struck across the spur of Whernscar. It was a\\ngrim, desolate part of the country; the bare rocks, upheaved in strange\\nshapes and unclothed by any greenery, seemed like the skeleton of the\\nearth exposed to view. Stone walls took the place of hedges, and there\\nwas scarcely a human habitation within sight. Scattered here and there\\nover the moorland were curious natural pits called \"potholes\", deep and\\ndark as wells, and with a sound of rushing water at the bottom. Into one\\nof these a small stream emptied itself, and was swallowed up bodily.\\n\\n\"They\\'re fearful places,\" said Dorothy, holding Gabrielle\\'s hand, and\\ngazing half-fascinated over the edge of the pit into the bubbling depths\\nbelow. \"It\\'s like a witch\\'s cauldron; you feel there\\'s \\'double, double,\\ntoil and trouble\\' going on down there.\"\\n\\n\"People must have been fearfully superstitious about these holes in\\nolden times,\" remarked Gabrielle.\\n\\n\"Rather! They attributed them to His Satanic Majesty--thought they were\\nthe blowholes of the nether world, in fact. I don\\'t suppose any of the\\nnatives here would care to go near them at night,\" said Percy.\\n\\n\"Come along! It makes me dizzy to stare down,\" said Gabrielle. \"I feel\\nas if something were drawing me in.\"\\n\\n\"The wizard who lives at the bottom!\" laughed Dorothy. \"We\\'re certainly\\nin a very peculiar part of the country. Is it far to the cave now?\"\\n\\n\"No, we\\'re quite close. I have my bearings, and I\\'m pretty sure that\\nit\\'s just round the other side of that crag.\"\\n\\n\"How exciting! Do let us be quick!\"\\n\\nThe mouth of the cave proved to be a small, narrow opening in the side\\nof the hill, no taller or wider than the little postern gate of an old\\ncastle. For a few yards inside there was a brown glimmer, but beyond lay\\ninky darkness. The girls, after a first peep, drew back with a shudder,\\nhalf of real fear, and half of delighted anticipation of a new\\nexperience. Percy had taken out the candles and was busy lighting them.\\n\\n\"There\\'s one for each of us,\" he said. \"And we must each have some\\nmatches in our pockets, in case of emergencies.\"\\n\\n\"What emergencies?\" asked Gabrielle.\\n\\n\"Well, suppose we got separated?\"\\n\\n\"Separated! Don\\'t talk of it. You\\'re not going to lose me, I can tell\\nyou. I shall hold on to your coat the whole way. I shan\\'t go in at all\\nif you mean to play hide-and-seek. Promise you won\\'t lose me!\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be silly! Nobody wants to lose you,\" said Percy. \"I\\'m only taking\\nproper precautions. There! Are you ready? Eric and I will go first, and\\nyou and Dorothy can follow.\"\\n\\n\"Shades of Pluto, it\\'s spooky!\" exclaimed Eric, leading the way.\\n\\nThe passage ran level for about fifteen yards, then began abruptly to\\ndescend into the hollow of the mountain. The walls were jagged and\\nuneven, there were frequent turnings and windings, and the floor was\\nrough with small stones or lumps of rock. In two or three places it was\\nvery damp. Moisture dripped from the roof and oozed in limestone tears\\ndown the walls, forming slimy, milky pools under foot. In the distance\\nthey could hear the gurgling of water. The two boys, as pioneers, walked\\nslowly, holding their lights so as to examine well the ground in front.\\nThe girls followed them closely.\\n\\n\"I should think it\\'s like this in the Catacombs,\" said Gabrielle.\\n\\n\"It reminds me of the story of the Princess and the Goblin,\" said\\nDorothy.\\n\\n\"Haven\\'t read it.\"\\n\\n\"You benighted girl! What you\\'ve missed! It\\'s the most gorgeous tale\\nthat was ever written. The goblins lived in a mountain just like this;\\nthey had a great underground hall, and dwellings in mysterious corners\\nand caves. They wanted to steal the little Princess Irene, to marry her\\nto their Prince, only Curdie outwitted them. I feel as if we\\'re\\nfollowing Irene\\'s thread at present.\"\\n\\n\"I hope you\\'re following me,\" said Eric. \"We\\'re coming to a bad place,\\nso you\\'d better go carefully.\"\\n\\nThe floor of the passage, which had been growing more and more uneven\\nand rugged, suddenly shelved down like a ladder.\\n\\n\"Yes, this is a bad bit,\" muttered Percy. \"It will certainly need care.\\nWhat a good thing I brought the rope!\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure it\\'s safe to venture?\" asked Gabrielle.\\n\\n\"Yes; it\\'s difficult, but it\\'s safe enough. Dr. Shaw told me about this\\nplace. It\\'s called \\'The Chute\\'; it\\'s something like a long smooth slide.\\nWe must lower one another with the rope.\"\\n\\n\"Who is to lower the last?\" said Dorothy.\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'ll manage to climb down all right without. Eric can go first,\\nthen he can help you two girls at the bottom.\"\\n\\nEric, with the rope tied round his waist, and his candle held well\\noverhead, started cautiously down the incline in a sitting posture.\\n\\n\"It\\'s as smooth as a slide,\" he called. \"Don\\'t pay out the rope too\\nfast, old chap. Let me down gently. That\\'s better. I\\'m getting along\\nfamously now. I can steady myself with one hand on the wall. Whew! That\\nwas a scorcher! There\\'s a nasty twist here. Steady! Let go a bit!\\nRight-o! Here I am!\"\\n\\nThe tension on the rope stopped, so he had evidently reached his goal.\\nThe others, peering into the darkness, could just see the glimmer of his\\ncandle round a piece of projecting rock.\\n\\n\"Where are you?\" they shouted.\\n\\n\"In a much wider passage. Come on! I\\'ve untied the rope, so you can wind\\nit up. It isn\\'t really difficult at all going down, if you\\'re careful of\\nthis corner at the end. I\\'ll climb up and give you each a hand as you\\ncome round.\"\\n\\n\"You go next, Dorothy,\" said Gabrielle.\\n\\nIt was rather a horrible experience, Dorothy thought, after the rope was\\ntied round her waist, to start on that steep, dark descent, even though\\nEric was waiting to help her at the bottom. The chute was moist, and as\\nslippery as ice; she felt dreadfully helpless, and if it had not been\\nfor the staying power of the rope, she would have shot down as if she\\nhad been tobogganing. She managed to aid herself a little by grasping\\nangles of the wall, though one hand was incommoded by holding the\\ncandle.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right. Don\\'t squeak--you\\'ve got over the worst now,\" said\\nEric, extending a welcome grip at the awkward corner. \"Put your foot\\nagainst that ledge; now then, swing yourself round.--Hi! More rope, up\\nthere!--Let yourself slide now--it\\'s only a few feet. You\\'ve done it!\\nHooray!\"\\n\\nDorothy felt like a heroine as she scrambled to her feet and untied the\\nrope. She peeped anxiously up the chute to see how Gabrielle would fare.\\nThe latter, after protesting vigorously that she daren\\'t and couldn\\'t\\nand wouldn\\'t, was at length persuaded to try, and accomplished the\\ndescent with many squeals of terror.\\n\\n\"Pooh! What a fuss you girls make!\" said Eric. \"There\\'s nothing to be\\nfrightened about.\"\\n\\nWhen his sister was safely landed at the bottom, Percy managed to\\ndescend unaided, and the four started once more on their march of\\nexploration. They were now in a long gallery, much loftier and wider\\nthan the passage above. It extended for about a hundred feet, then\\nnarrowed and lowered abruptly, so that for a few yards they were obliged\\nto stoop to get along. Suddenly they all stopped with a cry of\\namazement: the passage ended with a natural arch, and they found\\nthemselves staring into a vast subterranean chamber. The cavern was\\noval in shape, and had probably once been an underground reservoir for\\nwater. From the roof, like huge icicles, hung innumerable stalactites,\\nmany of which, meeting with stalagmites that rose from the floor, formed\\npillars as beautiful as the marble columns in a Greek temple. In the\\nfaint light of the four candles the scene was immensely impressive. The\\ncave seemed to stretch before the spectators like the dim aisles of some\\ngreat cathedral. They could not see to its farthest extent, but from\\nsomewhere in the distance came the noise of rushing water. Walking\\ncarefully between the stalagmites, they commenced a tour of\\ninvestigation, holding the lights high above their heads, so as to gain\\nas good a view as possible.\\n\\n\"If we only had a piece of magnesium ribbon to burn, wouldn\\'t it be\\nmagnificent?\" sighed Percy.\\n\\n\"Or even a motor lamp,\" added Eric.\\n\\nGuided by the sound of the water, they reached the corner of the\\nchamber, where a natural wonder presented itself. From a hole about\\nfifteen feet above them issued a cascade, which poured in a foaming fall\\nover a ledge of rock, ran for a distance of about eight yards over the\\nfloor of the cavern, then plunged into a deep hole and disappeared.\\n\\n\"I wonder where it comes out--if it ever comes out at all?\" said\\nDorothy, shuddering as she watched the black water whirl into the dark\\nabyss.\\n\\n\"Lower down the mountain, probably, but I shouldn\\'t care to try the\\nexperiment of jumping in to find out,\" said Eric. \"It\\'s a weird place,\\nbut it\\'s worth seeing. I\\'m glad we came. I believe it\\'s finer than\\nLingham. And we\\'ve done it on our own, too, without any bothersome\\nguide.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got to go back yet,\" said Gabrielle. \"Hadn\\'t we better make a\\nstart? It must be getting late.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly twenty minutes to four,\" said Percy, consulting his watch.\\n\\n\"Then we must go at once. Remember, we have a long walk before us.\"\\n\\nQuite loath to leave the marvels of the subterranean chamber, they tore\\nthemselves away, each first breaking off a small stalactite as a\\nsouvenir.\\n\\n\"I shall treasure my limestone \\'icicle\\',\" said Dorothy. \"I shall score\\nif I take it to the geology class at school.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got an extra one to give to the College museum,\" said Gabrielle.\\n\"I hope they won\\'t break in my pocket. I\\'ve wrapped them carefully in my\\nhandkerchief.\"\\n\\nArrived at the chute, Percy climbed up first, with one end of the rope\\nin his hand, then, stationing himself firmly at the top, announced his\\nreadiness to haul up the others. Gabrielle started next, crawling on\\nhands and knees, and helping herself as best she could by the\\nprojections of rock at the side. It was much more difficult to ascend\\nthan to descend, for the surface was so smooth and slippery, it was\\nimpossible to get any grip. Almost her whole weight depended upon the\\nrope; she was a heavy girl, and the strain was great. Percy at the top\\nheaved with all his strength.\\n\\n\"Oh dear, it\\'s dreadful!\" cried Gabrielle. \"It\\'s cutting my waist in\\ntwo. Wait a moment, Percy; don\\'t tug so hard. I want to catch this\\nledge.\"\\n\\n\"Let go of the rock, and I\\'ll give one good pull,\" commanded Percy. \"If\\nyou\\'ll trust yourself absolutely to me, I\\'ll have you up in a jiffy.\"\\n\\nGabrielle loosened her hold, and for one moment threw herself entirely\\nupon the rope. Perhaps it was not strong enough for the purpose, or\\npossibly it had been frayed in the descent by contact with a sharp rock;\\nthere was a snap, a sudden, agonized cry, and Gabrielle was precipitated\\nto the bottom of the chasm. She fell heavily, extinguishing her candle\\nas she went, and rolling almost to the feet of Eric and Dorothy, who\\nwere standing at the bottom of the chute looking upwards.\\n\\n\"Good gracious! What\\'s happened? Gabrielle, are you hurt?\" ejaculated\\nPercy, descending to the rescue with more haste than discretion, and\\nbending over the prostrate form of his sister. \"Hold a light, Eric; I\\ncan\\'t see her face.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Oh! I thought I was being killed!\" gasped Gabrielle, raising\\nherself to a sitting position. \"Give me your hand, Percy. Oh! Stop,\\nstop! My foot! I believe I\\'ve broken my ankle!\"\\n\\nThe explorers stared at one another in blankest dismay. This was indeed\\na predicament. What were they to do, buried in the depths of the earth,\\nand miles away from help of any kind?\\n\\n\"Are you sure it\\'s broken, or could you manage to get up if we each took\\nyour arm?\" suggested Eric.\\n\\n\"No! No! Don\\'t touch me! It\\'s agony if I move.\"\\n\\n\"Better let me pull your boot off, quick!\" said Dorothy, dropping on her\\nknees by the side of her friend.\\n\\nIt was a very different matter applying First Aid here from what it had\\nbeen at the ambulance class in the gymnasium at the College. Except\\npocket-handkerchiefs, there were no materials of any kind to be had.\\nSplints were an impossibility. Dorothy bound up the foot as well as she\\ncould, but her every touch was painful to her poor patient.\\n\\n\"You\\'re sitting in such a wet place! Couldn\\'t we lift you just a\\nlittle?\" she suggested.\\n\\n\"No; please leave me alone. Never mind the wet.\"\\n\\nGabrielle\\'s rosy cheeks had grown very white. She looked almost ready to\\nfaint. The two boys turned to each other in desperation.\\n\\n\"We can\\'t haul her up that chute with a broken ankle,\" said Percy. \"I\\nmust go back to the Hydro. for help, and you must stay with her. I\\'ll be\\nas quick as I possibly can--I\\'ll run all the way.\"\\n\\n\"Mind you don\\'t tumble into any \\'potholes\\', then,\" called Gabrielle\\nanxiously, as he scrambled up the chasm and departed.\\n\\nThen began a long, weary vigil of many interminable hours. The candles\\nhad burnt so low that the trio did not dare to have them all lighted\\ntogether, in case they should be left in the dark before assistance\\ncame. They therefore used one at a time, and by its faint gleam the deep\\nshadows of the rocks appeared more dim and gloomy than ever.\\n\\n\"It\\'s almost like being buried alive!\" shivered Gabrielle.\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad Alison didn\\'t come with us,\" said Dorothy.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve landed ourselves in an uncommonly tight fix,\" remarked Eric.\\n\\nWould the time never pass? Hour after hour went by. Wet, cold, and\\nhungry, and chilled to the bone, the unfortunate trio sat and waited.\\nThey were almost in despair when at last they heard a distant shout, and\\na few moments afterwards a strong light flashed down the chasm. The band\\nof rescuers proved to consist of Mr. Helm, Dr. Shaw (the medical\\nattendant of the Hydropathic), Dr. Longton, Mr. Clarke, and two\\ngardeners who were well acquainted with the neighbourhood, Percy, of\\ncourse, leading the way. They had brought motor lanterns, ropes, and a\\nnumber of other appliances, the most important of all in the eyes of the\\nthree shivering young people being a Thermos flask full of hot soup.\\n\\nThe first duty for the doctors was to set the broken ankle; then came\\nthe more critical task of removing the injured girl from the cave. Her\\nfather, who was fortunately the tallest and strongest member of the\\nparty, took her in his arms, and, aided partly by ropes and partly by\\nthe help of Dr. Longton and Mr. Clarke, he succeeded in carrying her up\\nthe slippery chute on to the level above. Even there their troubles were\\nnot over--the many twistings and windings and angles of the tortuous\\npassage were difficult to negotiate without giving undue pain to poor\\nGabrielle, who was already suffering enough. Her rescuers were only able\\nto proceed very slowly, and with frequent intervals of rest, and by the\\ntime the party reached the surface of the fell it was past eleven\\no\\'clock.\\n\\nNone of them ever forgot that weird midnight walk back to Ringborough.\\nIt was a wild, windy night, with heavy clouds chasing one another across\\nthe sky and obscuring the light of the waning moon. Hirst and Chorley,\\nthe two gardeners, led the way with the lanterns; then came Mr. Helm\\nand Dr. Shaw, carrying Gabrielle on an improvised stretcher; and the\\nothers followed closely behind, Dr. Longton helping Dorothy. The ground\\nwas rough and stony, and every now and then their guides had to stop to\\ntake their bearings, for there were several \"potholes\" and other danger\\nspots to be avoided. The first grey streak of dawn was showing in the\\nsky when the party, thoroughly exhausted, at last arrived at the\\nHydropathic.\\n\\n\"Gabrielle won\\'t be at the Coll. again for ever so long,\" said Alison to\\nDorothy next day. \"Dr. Shaw thinks it may be six weeks before she\\'s able\\nto walk. Uncle David says it\\'s a miracle she wasn\\'t killed. I\\'m glad I\\ndidn\\'t go--and yet\" (rather wistfully) \"I don\\'t suppose I shall ever\\nhave the opportunity of a real adventure again. It must have been so\\nexciting!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s nicer to read about adventures than to have them,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"It wasn\\'t thrilling at all at the time--it was cold and wet and horrid.\\nI\\'m delighted to have seen the cave, but I wouldn\\'t go through last\\nnight again--not if anyone offered me a hundred pounds!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\nA School Anniversary\\n\\n\\nDorothy returned to Hurford with a whole world of new experiences to\\nrelate to Aunt Barbara. The visit to Ringborough had indeed been an\\nimmense enjoyment, and after so much excitement it was difficult to\\nsettle down to the round of school and lessons. With some natures change\\nis a tonic that sets them once more in tune with their everyday\\nsurroundings; but with others it only rouses desires for what they\\ncannot get. Unfortunately it had this effect in Dorothy\\'s case. Her\\npleasant time at the Hydropathic, the amusements there, and her\\ncompanionship with other young people, which she had so much\\nappreciated, all combined to bring out into sharp contrast the quietness\\nand uneventfulness of her ordinary existence, and to make her life at\\nHolly Cottage seem dull and monotonous. The old cloud settled down upon\\nher, and the old discontented look crept back into her eyes.\\n\\nAunt Barbara, who had hoped the holiday would cheer her up, was frankly\\ndisappointed. She was uneasy and anxious about Dorothy; she felt that\\nsome undesirable element was working in the girl\\'s mind, yet she could\\nnot define exactly of what it consisted. It was a negative rather than a\\npositive quality, and manifested itself more in acts of omission than\\nthose of commission. Dorothy was rarely disagreeable at home, but she\\nhad lately slidden out of many of the little pettings and fond, loving\\nways that had meant so much to Aunt Barbara, and her manner had grown\\nsomewhat hard and uncompromising. Small things count for so much in\\ndaily life, and Dorothy, absorbed in her own troubles, never thought\\nwhat value might be set on a kiss, or what the lack of it might seem to\\nthat tender heart which had made her happiness its own.\\n\\nAt present she was engrossed in Avondale concerns, for the coming term\\nwas the fullest and busiest in the school year. Not only was there the\\nwork of her own form to be considered, but the many side interests in\\nconnection with the College also--the Ambulance Guild, the Botanical\\nSociety (a special feature of the summer months), and last, but not\\nleast, the Dramatic Union, to be a member of which she was justly proud.\\nHer inclusion in this, though a supreme satisfaction, brought the\\npenalty of added work. She was expected to learn parts and submit to\\nsevere drilling at rehearsals, the standard required being greatly above\\nwhat had contented the Upper Fourth.\\n\\nThe Union was looking forward to shortly displaying its talent on the\\noccasion of the school festival. This was to be held on the twelfth of\\nMay, partly because it was the anniversary of the laying of the\\nfoundation stone of the present building, and partly because, being old\\nMay Day, it gave an opportunity for many quaint and charming methods of\\ncelebration.\\n\\nMiss Tempest, who loved to revive bygone customs, had introduced maypole\\nplaiting, morris dances, and other ancient \"joyous devices\" at the\\nschool, and the girls had taken them up with enthusiasm. At this\\nfestival, instead of giving dances and May Day carols, such as had been\\npopular for the last year or two, the Dramatic Union was to act a floral\\npageant called \"The Masque of the Blossoms\", a pretty performance in\\nwhich interesting old catches and madrigals were included, and many\\nhistorical and emblematical characters represented. Miss Hicks, the\\nsinging mistress, undertook the direction of the musical part of the\\npiece, and coached the girls at private practices in the songs.\\n\\nDorothy, after the allotment of the parts, came home brimming over with\\nexcitement.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the most delightful, quaint thing, Auntie! \\'Queen Elizabeth\\' is in\\nit, and \\'Raleigh\\' and \\'Spenser\\', as well as \\'Venus\\' and two nymphs, and\\nthe spirit of the woodlands. The songs are charming. I know you\\'ll like\\n\\'Now is the month of maying\\' and \\'The trees all budding\\'. Nora Burgess\\nis to be \\'Leader of the Masque\\', and Ottilia Partington is \\'Spring\\'. And\\noh, Auntie! what do you guess is my part? I\\'m to be \\'Queen of the\\nDaffodils\\'! It lay between me and Vera Norland; we both knew the words\\nequally well, so we drew lots, and I won. I\\'ve brought a book to show\\nyou what the costume must be. Look! it gives a picture.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s extremely pretty, but it seems rather elaborate,\" said Miss\\nSherbourne, scanning the dainty creation figured in the illustration\\nwith an eye to its home-dressmaking possibilities.\\n\\n\"Do you think so? The green part\\'s to be made of satin, and the skirt\\nunderneath is all folds of soft yellow silk, to represent petals. Then\\nthere are wreaths of artificial daffodils, and a veil of gauze covered\\nwith gold sequins.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps we can copy it in sateen and art muslin,\" said Aunt Barbara.\\n\\n\"Auntie! It ought to be real silk and satin! It won\\'t look anything if\\nit\\'s only made of cheap materials.\"\\n\\n\"But I can\\'t afford to buy dearer ones for a costume that will only be\\nused once.\"\\n\\n\"Muriel, and Fanny, and Olga, who are taking the other flowers, are\\nhaving beautiful things made at a dressmaker\\'s,\" returned Dorothy rather\\nsulkily.\\n\\n\"I dare say; but that doesn\\'t make it any easier for us.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t be the only one in a cheap dress!\" burst out Dorothy. \"Oh,\\nAuntie, you might let me have something nice, just for once! It\\'s too\\nbad that I never get anything like other girls.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t know what you ask, Dorothy,\" said Miss Sherbourne, with a\\npained tone in her voice. \"I do all for you that\\'s in my power. It hurts\\nme to deny you even more than it hurts you to go without what you want.\\nNo, I can\\'t promise anything; you must learn to realize what a small\\nmargin we have for luxuries.\"\\n\\nDorothy flung down the book and rushed upstairs to her bedroom. She was\\nthoroughly out of temper, and hot tears started to her eyes. She had set\\nher heart on making a good effect as \"Queen of the Daffodils\". It was an\\nimportant part in the Masque, and she was extremely triumphant that the\\nlot had fallen to her. To act at the College Anniversary was a great\\nhonour, and Dorothy knew that Hope Lawson and Valentine Barnett, neither\\nof whom was included this time, would have been only too delighted to\\nhave her chance.\\n\\n\"They envy me ever so much, and it will make them extra-censorious,\" she\\nthought. \"They\\'ll turn up their noses dreadfully if I only wear a\\ncostume of sateen and art muslin.\"\\n\\nTo Dorothy, who had not yet forgotten her disappointment at losing the\\nelection for the Wardenship, and who was always on the defensive against\\nreal or imaginary slights, this occasion of the festival seemed a unique\\nopportunity of asserting her position in the school. She knew, from\\nformer experience, how the girls discussed and criticized the dresses\\nworn by the players, and what elaborate and expensive costumes were\\noften provided: many beautiful accessories in the way of scenery were\\ngenerally lent by parents of the pupils, and the whole performance was\\non a very handsome scale. To be one of the masquers in this year\\'s\\npageant would increase her social standing, and magnify her importance\\nin her Form as nothing else could possibly do. She pictured the triumph\\nof the scene, the select company of picked actors on the platform, the\\nmusic, the flowers, and the lovely effects of colour grouping. The large\\nlecture hall would be filled to overflowing with pupils and guests.\\nAlison\\'s uncle would no doubt be there, and Percy and Eric Helm. She\\nwould like them to see her as \"Queen of the Daffodils\". She might give\\nthree \"performer\\'s invitations\", so she could ask Dr. and Mrs. Longton\\nas well as Aunt Barbara. Oh, it would be the event of her life! But how\\nwas all this to happen if she could not be provided with a suitable\\ncostume?\\n\\n\"What it comes to is this,\" she said to herself. \"The thing, to be done\\nat all, ought to be done well; the girls will laugh at me if I turn up\\nin sateen, with sixpence-halfpenny bunches of daffodils. I\\'d rather not\\nact if I can\\'t have a nice dress. Aunt Barbara might manage it somehow.\"\\n\\nDorothy did her lessons in her den that evening, although there was no\\nfire and the weather was still cold. She came down to supper so moody\\nand unresponsive that Miss Sherbourne, after a vain attempt at\\nconversation, gave up the effort, and the meal passed almost in silence.\\nThe subject of the Masque was not mentioned by either.\\n\\nDorothy cried bitterly in bed that night, hot scalding tears of\\ndisappointment--tears that did not soften and relieve her grief, but\\nonly made it harder to bear; and she woke next morning with a splitting\\nheadache.\\n\\n\"Have you finished with this book, Auntie?\" she said after breakfast,\\ntaking up the ill-fated catalogue of costumes, which had been left the\\nnight before on the sideboard.\\n\\n\"You might leave it for a day or two, if Miss Hicks can spare it,\"\\nreplied Miss Sherbourne. \"There is still plenty of time before May the\\ntwelfth.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter with Dorothy?\" said Mavie Morris that morning at\\nschool. \"She\\'s so glum and cross, one can\\'t get a civil word from her.\\nWhen I mentioned the pageant, she nearly snapped my head off.\"\\n\\n\"Tantrums again, I suppose,\" said Ruth Harmon, shrugging her shoulders.\\n\"The best plan is to leave her alone till she comes out of them. You\\nought to know Dorothy Greenfield by this time.\"\\n\\n\"You shouldn\\'t tease her,\" said Grace Russell.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t. I only asked her what her dress was to be like, and she told\\nme to mind my own business. All those who are acting are just full of\\ntheir costumes. They talk of nothing else.\"\\n\\n\"Is Dorothy\\'s going to be a nice one?\" asked Ruth.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know; she wouldn\\'t tell me anything. Dorothy doesn\\'t generally\\nhave handsome things, does she?\"\\n\\n\"No; she\\'s one of the plainest-dressed girls in the Form.\"\\n\\n\"But she\\'ll surely come out in something decent for the Masque! She\\nmust, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps that\\'s the rub--poor Dorothy!\" murmured Grace Russell.\\n\\nWhen Dorothy returned home that afternoon she found Miss Sherbourne busy\\nat her writing table. Generally all papers were cleared away before\\ntea-time, and Aunt Barbara was ready to help with lessons, or play games\\nand chat afterwards; to-day, however, she instituted a new regime.\\n\\n\"I am going to write in the evenings now,\" she said, \"so you must be\\nquiet, dear, and not disturb me. I have a piece of work that I\\nparticularly want to finish.\"\\n\\nDorothy prepared her German translation and learned her Latin\\nvocabularies, then, taking up a volume of Scott, began to read. It was\\nrather dull with only the scratching of Aunt Barbara\\'s pen to break the\\nsilence. She missed their usual game of chess and their pleasant talk.\\nIt seemed so extraordinary not to be allowed to say a single word. The\\nnext evening and the next the programme was the same. Except at meal\\ntimes, Dorothy hardly had the opportunity of exchanging ideas with Aunt\\nBarbara. She did not like the innovation.\\n\\n\"Auntie does nothing but write--write--write the whole time,\" she\\ncomplained to Martha.\\n\\n\"Yes; she\\'s overdoing it entirely, and I\\'ve told her so!\" returned\\nMartha indignantly. \"She\\'s at it from morning till night, and then she\\'s\\nnot finished, for she\\'s sitting up to the small hours. There\\'s no sense\\nin fagging like that. You can\\'t burn a candle at both ends.\"\\n\\n\"Then why does she?\" questioned Dorothy.\\n\\n\"That\\'s what I asked her. She\\'s not strong enough to stand it. She\\'s\\nbeen ill again lately, and if she doesn\\'t mind she\\'ll have a breakdown.\"\\n\\n\"Auntie, won\\'t you go to bed early too?\" suggested Dorothy, as she said\\ngood night, looking rather anxiously at the pale face bent over the\\npapers. Miss Sherbourne put her hand to her head wearily.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t. I must make a push and put in a certain number of hours\\' work,\\nor these articles will never be finished in time. If I can send them in\\nby the second, and they are accepted, I may possibly get a cheque for\\nthem at once. That would just give us time before the twelfth. We can\\'t\\nbuy silks and satins without the wherewithal, can we?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Auntie! are you slaving like this for me?\" exclaimed Dorothy.\\n\"Can\\'t we get the dress any other way?\"\\n\\n\"No, dear; I can\\'t afford it out of the house-keeping money, and it is\\none of my rules never to run into debt for anything. Don\\'t worry;\\nanother day will see me through, and I think the editor of the\\n_Coleminster Gazette_ will like the articles--they\\'re better than the\\nones he accepted last year.\"\\n\\nDorothy went upstairs uneasy and dissatisfied with herself. Aunt\\nBarbara\\'s good-night kiss had roused something that had been slumbering\\nfor a long time. Thoughts that the girl had suppressed lately began to\\nmake themselves heard, and to clamour loudly and reproachfully. She\\ntried to put them away, but they refused to be dismissed. With her eyes\\nshut tight in bed, she seemed to see a vision of Aunt Barbara\\'s tired\\nface as she sat working, working so painfully hard in the sitting-room\\nbelow.\\n\\n\"And for me--always for me--never for herself,\" reflected Dorothy. \"She\\nhasn\\'t bought a new dress of her own this spring, though she needs one\\nbadly.\"\\n\\nShe looked with compunction next morning at Miss Sherbourne\\'s pale\\ncheeks.\\n\\n\"Does your head ache, Auntie?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I haven\\'t been quite well lately, but I expect it will pass. You\\nshall buy me some phenacetin powders in town; they always do my head\\ngood. Dr. Longton recommended them.\"\\n\\n\"She looks more fit to be in bed than at her writing table,\" thought\\nDorothy, as she left the room, armed with the necessary prescription.\\nShe hurried away from school at four o\\'clock in order to give herself\\ntime to call at the chemist\\'s, and ran anxiously into the house on her\\nreturn, bearing the packet of powders in triumph.\\n\\n\"Sh! Sh! Don\\'t make a noise,\" said Martha, coming from the kitchen.\\n\"Your aunt\\'s lying down. I told her it would come to this, and I\\'ve\\nproved my words. It\\'s an attack of her old complaint. It always comes\\nback with overwork.\"\\n\\n\"Is she really very ill?\" faltered Dorothy.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. I\\'ve just sent Jones\\'s boy with a message for Dr.\\nLongton. No, you mustn\\'t go disturbing her till he\\'s been. Take your\\nthings off, and I\\'ll bring you your tea.\"\\n\\nDorothy ate her solitary meal in sad distress. She could remember two\\nformer illnesses of Aunt Barbara\\'s, and she was old enough now to\\nrealize how much cause there was for alarm. She waylaid the doctor on\\nhis arrival, and begged him to allow her to be of help.\\n\\n\"If Auntie is really going to be ill like she was before, let me be her\\nnurse,\" she implored. \"I learnt a great deal at the ambulance classes,\\nand I\\'d carry out every single thing you told me.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll see. I must examine my patient first,\" replied her old friend.\\n\\nDorothy sat on the stairs waiting with a beating heart while Dr. Longton\\nwas in Miss Sherbourne\\'s room. She sprang up eagerly as he came out, and\\naccompanied him to the porch. She hardly dared to ask for his verdict.\\n\\n\"Yes, it\\'s a nasty return of the old trouble,\" said the doctor. \"I\\'m\\nafraid she\\'s in for a sharp attack, but luckily I was sent for in good\\ntime, and may be able to stave things off a little. So you\\'re anxious to\\ntry your hand at nursing, young woman? Well, I don\\'t see why you\\nshouldn\\'t. You and Martha can manage quite well between you, if you\\'ll\\nonly carry out my directions absolutely to the letter. When I suggested\\nsending for a trained nurse, your aunt was very much against the\\nidea--begged me not to, in fact. Martha has a head on her shoulders, and\\nyou\\'re not a child now.\"\\n\\n\"I shall soon be fifteen,\" said Dorothy, drawing herself to her full\\nheight.\\n\\n\"Well, here\\'s your chance to show what you\\'re worth. If you can manage\\nin this emergency, I shall have some opinion of you. I can telephone to\\nthe Nursing Institution if I find it\\'s too much for you.\"\\n\\n\"I hope that won\\'t be necessary,\" replied Dorothy.\\n\\nIn that one hour she seemed to have suddenly grown years older, and to\\nhave taken up a new burden of responsibility. Martha hardly knew her\\nwhen she entered the sick room, she seemed so unwontedly calm and\\nresourceful, yet withal so gentle, so tactful, and so deft and clever in\\ndoing all that was required for the invalid.\\n\\n\"I\\'d no idea the bairn could be so helpful,\" murmured Martha to herself.\\n\"If she goes on as well as she shapes, we\\'ll do without a nurse, and\\nthat\\'ll ease Miss Sherbourne\\'s mind. She can\\'t afford two guineas a\\nweek, let alone the woman\\'s keep, and it would worry her to think of the\\nexpense. As far as I\\'m concerned I don\\'t want a nurse in the house,\\nmaking extra trouble and what waste goodness knows!\"\\n\\nThe first thing Dorothy did when she could be spared from Aunt\\nBarbara\\'s room was to find her blotter and write a letter to Vera\\nNorland. It ran thus:\\n\\n    \"DEAR VERA,--Can you take the part of \\'Queen of the Daffodils\\'\\n    instead of me? My aunt is very ill, and I am afraid I shall not\\n    be able to come to school for a while, so I shall miss the\\n    rehearsals. I thought I had better let you know at once, so that\\n    you will have time to get your dress.\\n        \"Sincerely yours,\\n            \"DOROTHY GREENFIELD.\"\\n\\nShe ran out herself and posted the letter, then came back and quietly\\nsat down again by Aunt Barbara\\'s bedside. It cost her a great pang thus\\nto give up her part in the festival, but once the irrevocable step was\\ntaken, and the letter in the pillar box, she felt much better.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve just got to forget about that pageant, Dorothy Greenfield,\" she\\nsaid to herself. \"You\\'ve been behaving abominably lately, and I\\'m\\nthoroughly ashamed of you. Now\\'s your chance indeed, as the doctor says.\\nI only hope it hasn\\'t come too late. Oh, you nasty, ungrateful, selfish,\\nthoughtless thing, how I despise you!\"\\n\\nAs Dr. Longton had anticipated, Miss Sherbourne had a sharp attack of\\nher former complaint. For a week she lay very ill, and her two devoted\\nnurses hardly left her day or night. It was a new experience to Dorothy\\nto have Aunt Barbara, who had been accustomed to do everything for her,\\nlying helpless and dependent upon her care. It brought out the grit in\\nthe girl\\'s character, and made her see many things to which she had\\nbefore been blind. Hitherto Dorothy had not been at all zealous at\\nhelping in the house, but now she cheerfully washed plates and dishes,\\nand did many other tasks that were distasteful to her.\\n\\n\"\\'As one that serveth\\'\" she often said to herself as she went about the\\ndaily duties, trying to take her fair share of the trouble and help\\npoor, faithful Martha, whose devotion never slackened. She wore the\\nlittle badge of the Guild constantly, that its remembrance might be\\nalways with her. \"\\'As one that serveth\\'; Miss Tempest said that the\\nmotto ought to mean so much in one\\'s life,\" she thought. \"I didn\\'t\\nunderstand before, but I do now. When Auntie gets better, I\\'m going to\\nbe very different.\"\\n\\nIt was a joyful day for Martha and Dorothy when the doctor pronounced\\nMiss Sherbourne out of danger.\\n\\n\"She has made a wonderful recovery,\" he said, \"and if she only takes\\nproper care of herself she ought to get on nicely now. She has had a\\nsplendid pair of nurses. Honestly, Dorothy, I never thought you would be\\nable to manage without professional help. You\\'ve done very well, child,\\nvery well indeed.\"\\n\\nThis was high praise from bluff old Dr. Longton, and Dorothy flushed\\nwith pleasure. She was glad if she had been able, in the least degree,\\nto return to Aunt Barbara any of the love and tenderness that the latter\\nhad lavished upon her for more than fourteen years. The debt was still\\nso great, it seemed impossible ever to pay it back.\\n\\nOnce the fever had left her, Miss Sherbourne made rapid progress, and by\\nthe twelfth of May she was able to come downstairs for the first time.\\nDorothy made the little dining-room so gay with flowers for her\\nreception that it looked like a May Day festival.\\n\\n\"Why, sweetheart, this is the day of your school anniversary,\" said Aunt\\nBarbara, as she and Dorothy sat at tea. \"You ought to have been acting\\n\\'Queen of the Daffodils\\'.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t talk of that, Auntie! I got Vera to take it instead.\"\\n\\nDorothy\\'s eyes were full of tears.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry you were disappointed, darling.\"\\n\\n\"Auntie, it\\'s not that; please don\\'t misunderstand me. Ever since you\\nwere ill I\\'ve wanted to tell you that I know now what a nasty,\\nungrateful wretch I\\'ve been. You\\'ve been working and toiling for me all\\nthese years, and I took it just as a matter of course, and never\\nthought how much you were giving up for me. I\\'m going to work for you\\nnow. I\\'m afraid I can\\'t do much at first--with money, I mean--but I\\'ll\\ntry my hardest at the Coll., and perhaps in a year or two I may be a\\nhelp instead of a burden.\"\\n\\n\"A burden you have never been, child,\" said Miss Sherbourne. \"If I had\\nonly got well a little sooner, we would have made you the costume. I\\nsent the articles off the afternoon I was taken ill, and a cheque for\\nthem came a week ago.\"\\n\\n\"Then you must spend it on yourself, please. No, I\\'m glad the daffodil\\ndress wasn\\'t made. I should always have hated myself for having it.\"\\n\\n\"But you\\'ve missed the whole festival,\" regretted Aunt Barbara.\\n\\n\"Never mind, it\\'s May Day here as well as at Avondale. Look at the lilac\\nand the columbines, and this bowl of wallflowers! The air is so sweet\\nand soft now, and there\\'s a thrush\\'s nest in the garden. All the harsh\\nwinds and the cold seem to be gone, and summer has come.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, summer has indeed come,\" said Aunt Barbara, gazing, not at the\\nflowers, but at Dorothy\\'s face, where a new, softened look had replaced\\nthe old frown of discontent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\nWater Plantain\\n\\n\\nDorothy returned to Avondale resolved to work doubly hard. There was\\ncertainly plenty to be done if she did not wish to fall behind in her\\nForm. She had missed many of the lessons, and to recover the ground that\\nshe had lost meant studying the textbooks by herself, and trying to\\nassimilate endless pages of arrears.\\n\\n\"Yet I must,\" she thought. \"If I leave out the least scrap, that\\'s sure\\nto be the very piece I shall get in the exam. I\\'m going over every\\nsingle line--though it\\'s cruel translating Virgil and learning Racine in\\nsuch big doses. Never mind, Dorothy Greenfield, you\\'ve got to do it. I\\nshan\\'t let you off, however much you hate it.\"\\n\\nFaithful to her determination, Dorothy set the alarum in her bedroom for\\na quarter to six, and had nearly an hour and a half\\'s study each morning\\nbefore Martha called her at 7.15. It was very tempting sometimes to turn\\nover and go to sleep again; but she soon began to grow quite used to her\\nearly rising, and it seemed almost a shame to stay in bed when the sun\\nwas up, and the thrush was singing cheerily in the elder bush outside.\\n\\n[Illustration: A NURSING EXPERIENCE]\\n\\nThe aim that Dorothy had in view was so ambitious that she hardly dared\\nconfess it even to herself. Every year a prize was given at Avondale\\ncalled the William Scott Memorial. It was thus named after the founder\\nof the College, who had left a sum of money in his will for the purpose.\\nIt was awarded annually to the girl in any form who obtained the highest\\npercentage of marks in the examinations. Though it was generally gained\\nby members of the Sixth, it did not of necessity fall to them; every\\ngirl had an equal opportunity, for it went entirely by their relative\\nscores, the object being to distinguish the pupil who had worked the\\nbest, irrespective of age.\\n\\n\"I believe it fell once to the Second; but the Sixth have had it for\\nfour years now,\" thought Dorothy. \"Time for a new departure. I don\\'t\\nsuppose I\\'ve the slightest ghost of a chance, but it\\'s worth trying. I\\nshan\\'t mention my hopes to anybody, though--not even to Aunt\\nBarbara--they\\'re so remote.\"\\n\\nHer increased efforts could not fail to win notice, however, at the\\nCollege.\\n\\n\"Dorothy Greenfield, you\\'re just swatting!\" said Mavie Morris one day.\\n\"I don\\'t believe you\\'d a fault in your last German exercise, and you\\nrecited all that Virgil without one single slip. What\\'s come over you?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" replied Dorothy, turning a little red. \"You talk as if I\\'d\\nbeen committing a crime.\"\\n\\n\"So you have. You\\'re raising the general average of the standard, and\\nthat\\'s not fair to the rest of the Form. When Pittie sees you with three\\n\\'excellents\\' to your name, she thinks I ought to do the same.\"\\n\\n\"Why can\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Why? You ask me why? Do you think I\\'m going to muddle my brains more\\nthan I can help, just in the middle of the tennis season? You little\\nknow Mavie Morris. No, Dorothy, I\\'ve a distinct grievance against you.\\nThere you are now--actually surreptitiously squinting at a book while\\nI\\'m talking to you!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not a lesson book, at any rate; it\\'s from the library,\" retorted\\nDorothy.\\n\\n\"Let me look at it. You humbug, it\\'s a Manual of Botany! I call that\\nlessons, in all conscience.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it has jolly coloured illustrations,\" said Dorothy, trying to\\nplead extenuating circumstances. \"I want to hunt out the names of some\\nspecimens I\\'ve found. We have heaps of wild flowers growing in the lanes\\nat Hurford.\"\\n\\n\"Whitewashed, but not exonerated! Your manual smacks too much of school\\nfor my taste. Why don\\'t you take a leaf from me and practise tennis?\"\\n\\n\"No luck for such a bad server as I am.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I didn\\'t say you\\'d win the championship. I\\'ve no chance myself\\nagainst Val and Margaret. Here\\'s Alison; she\\'ll reason with you. She\\nisn\\'t on the rising balance of the Form any more than I am myself.\\nAlison, tell Dorothy to quit this everlasting studying. Don\\'t you agree\\nwith me that it makes it far harder for us slackers?\"\\n\\nAlison laughed good-naturedly. She never troubled much about her own\\nlessons, for her mother was generally so anxious regarding her health,\\nand so afraid of her overworking herself, that an hour\\'s preparation\\nsufficed for her home work--and, indeed, if she took more, Mrs. Clarke\\nwould threaten to complain to Miss Tempest.\\n\\n\"Yes, Dorothy\\'s turning into quite an old bookworm,\" she replied. \"She\\neven insisted on looking over her Latin in the train this morning. I\\ncan\\'t stand that, because I always like to talk. I don\\'t get too much of\\nDorothy\\'s company.\"\\n\\nIt was still a grievance to Alison that her mother would not sanction\\nany closer intimacy with her friend. She had hoped, after the visit to\\nRingborough, that matters would be on a different footing, and that she\\nwould be allowed to introduce Dorothy at home and invite her frequently.\\nShe could not understand why, for no apparently adequate reason, she\\nmust be debarred from her society. The fact that she was discouraged\\nfrom being on too familiar terms had the effect of making her even more\\nenthusiastic in her affection. There was a strong vein of obstinacy in\\nher disposition, and if she once took up an idea she was apt to keep to\\nit.\\n\\n\"Uncle David likes Dorothy,\" she argued. \"He told Mother not to be\\nridiculous. I heard him say so. Perhaps in time I shall get my own way.\"\\n\\nMrs. Clarke, anxious not to thwart her darling more than was necessary,\\nhad many times proposed that some other classmate from Avondale should\\nbe asked to Lindenlea. But Alison had flatly refused.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t possibly have Grace Russell or Ruth Harmon without inviting\\nDorothy. She\\'d think it most peculiar and unkind. No, Mother dearest, if\\nI mayn\\'t have her I\\'d rather not ask anybody at all.\"\\n\\n\"But you ought to have young companions, Birdie,\" protested Mrs. Clarke\\nfretfully. \"Your uncle was speaking to me on that very subject before he\\nwent to Scotland; and he is your guardian, so he is partly responsible\\nfor you. I believe I shall have to send you to a boarding school after\\nall.\"\\n\\n\"No, no; I should be miserable, and so would you without me. I\\'d hate to\\nleave the Coll. Don\\'t worry, Motherkins, Uncle David shan\\'t lecture you.\\nNaughty fellow! I won\\'t be friends with him if he hints at boarding\\nschool again.\"\\n\\n\"I shall certainly talk it over with him when he returns from Lochaber,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Clarke.\\n\\n\"When is he coming back? Is he really going to take a house near here,\\nMother?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. He may possibly settle in the South, in which case I\\nshould certainly decide to remove, and to go and live near him.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, please no! I don\\'t want to leave Latchworth or the Coll.,\"\\nprotested Alison.\\n\\nAlison was indeed absolutely happy at Avondale. For a day school the\\narrangements were perfect, and there were many features of the course\\nthere which suited her tastes. She liked the Ambulance Guild and the\\nTennis Club, and both the gymnasium and the laboratory were large and\\nspecially well equipped, far more so than in most boarding schools. This\\nterm, also, Miss Carter, the science mistress, had begun a very\\ninteresting series of Nature Study lessons, which included birds and\\ninsects, and made a special point of botany; and Alison, who adored\\nflowers, threw herself into it heart and soul. It was the one subject\\nover which she really gave herself much trouble. She collected specimens\\nand pressed them, identified them from the big volumes of \"Sowerby\" in\\nthe library at Lindenlea, mounted them on sheets of cardboard, and\\nprinted their names neatly underneath.\\n\\n\"I shall have something to send to the Arts and Crafts Exhibition,\" she\\nsaid, \"though I\\'m no good at anything else.\"\\n\\n\"No good! Fiddlesticks!\" exclaimed Dorothy.\\n\\n\"True, my dear! Have you ever seen me top at an exam., or even second?\\nWhy, I only get \\'excellent\\' once in a blue moon, and then I\\'m so\\nastonished, I think it must be a mistake! I\\'m not picked out to play at\\nschool concerts, or recite, or act, or show off in any way. Oh, don\\'t\\nthink I\\'m complaining! I don\\'t crave for notoriety. There\\'s nothing I\\ndetest worse than having to perform in public. But pressed flowers are\\ndifferent. I can do them in private at home, and let them be seen\\nwithout exhibiting myself. I wish I could find a few more specimens. I\\nbelieve I\\'ve picked everything that\\'s to be had at Latchworth.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Carter promised she\\'d take us a botanizing ramble some afternoon,\"\\nsaid Dorothy.\\n\\n\"So she did. We must keep her to her word. Let us try to catch her now\\nin the corridor, and see if we can get her to name a definite day. Ask\\nMavie and Grace to come too. They\\'re the keenest next to us.\"\\n\\nThe little group of enthusiasts waylaid the mistress as she came out of\\nthe library, and, reminding her of the projected expedition, nailed her\\nto the point.\\n\\n\"Very well, we will decide on next Saturday afternoon, provided, of\\ncourse, that it\\'s a fine day,\" replied Miss Carter.\\n\\n\"And the place?\" asked Alison.\\n\\n\"I think we can\\'t do better than Beechfield. We could walk along the\\nembankment to Longacre, and take the train back from there. We ought to\\nfind plenty of flowers on the way.\"\\n\\n\"And we might stop and have tea somewhere,\" suggested Alison, who was\\ndetermined to make an outing of it.\\n\\n\"Yes, so we might. There\\'s an inn by the river about half-way to\\nLongacre, and several cottages that cater for visitors.\"\\n\\n\"We can start quite early, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll look up the railway guide, and pin a programme on the notice board\\nto-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"There, you see!\" said Alison, as the deputation returned in triumph,\\n\"there\\'s nothing like sticking to a thing. I believe in people keeping\\npromises when they make them.\"\\n\\n\"We shall have a ripping afternoon. Miss Carter is ever so jolly.\"\\n\\n\"And I expect she\\'ll be jollier still when she\\'s \\'off duty\\'.\"\\n\\nNotwithstanding the tempting nature of the programme, only ten put down\\ntheir names for the botanizing expedition. In summer there were many\\ndiversions for Saturday\\'s holiday--the tennis season was in full swing,\\nand the girls had attractions at their own homes that outweighed a\\ncountry ramble.\\n\\n\"It\\'s far nicer without too many,\" declared Alison. \"I\\'ve been school\\nexcursions before, at Leamstead, and it\\'s generally so hard to get\\neverybody to come along. Half the party is always lagging behind, and\\nthen a dozen come running up and want all the explanations over again,\\njust when the mistress has finished describing something. You waste an\\nimmense amount of time in collecting people. I mean to stick to Miss\\nCarter like glue the whole afternoon.\"\\n\\n\"Absorbing information like a piece of blotting-paper!\" laughed Mavie.\\n\"Quite a new character for you, Alison Clarke.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t mock. You\\'re as keen on going as I am myself.\"\\n\\nThe ten Nature students met Miss Carter at Coleminster station at\\nhalf-past two on the Saturday, and started off for Beechfield, which was\\non a different line from Hurford and Latchworth. Neither Dorothy nor\\nAlison knew the place, so to them at least it had the charm of novelty.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve often walked over the fields to Longacre,\" said Grace Russell,\\n\"but I don\\'t mind going again. It will seem fresh if we\\'re looking for\\nflowers. I like an object when I\\'m out.\"\\n\\n\"And I like the fun of being out, object or no object,\" said Mavie. \"I\\nhonestly confess I\\'m looking forward to tea-time.\"\\n\\n\"You shameless materialist!\" said Miss Carter. \"You shan\\'t have a single\\ncup unless you can name a dozen flowers. I shall put you through an\\nexamination first.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be attentive--with tea as my goal.\"\\n\\nThere was no doubt about it--Miss Carter was jolly. She talked and joked\\nas merrily as the girls themselves, climbed stiles with agility, and,\\nmuch to her pupils\\' amusement, exhibited an abject terror of cows.\\n\\n\"It was born in me, and I can\\'t conquer it,\" she declared. \"I suppose\\nit\\'s partly because I\\'m town-bred. The very sight of their horns puts me\\nin a panic.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll walk along first and shoo them away with my umbrella,\" said\\nDorothy, laughing.\\n\\n\"What heroism! I really envy your courage. To me the pleasures of botany\\nare sadly spoilt by cows; there is invariably one in the meadow where I\\nwant to pick my best specimens.\"\\n\\nIn spite of her real or pretended fears, Miss Carter ventured to take\\nthe path which led over the fields to Longacre. It was a pretty walk,\\npartly through a park shaded with beautiful trees, and partly along an\\nembankment which formed the remains of an ancient fortification against\\nthe Danes. The hay was still uncut, so the fields were full of flowers,\\nand without unduly trespassing into the long grass the girls were able\\nto pick many specimens. Alison kept to her intention of sticking to Miss\\nCarter, and scarcely left her side; she enjoyed the explanations, and\\npassed them on to Mavie, who was collecting her dozen plants with\\nostentatious zeal. Dorothy was told off as policeman to bring up\\nstragglers.\\n\\n\"We shall never get there at all if you can\\'t keep together and come\\nalong,\" said Miss Carter. \"I can see a little peep of the river, and one\\nchimney of the inn over there in the distance. Don\\'t you feel inclined\\nfor tea?\"\\n\\n\"Rather!\" agreed the girls, making a spurt.\\n\\nThe inn was one of those small, wayside places common in rural\\ndistricts. It catered for anglers and tourists, and had a pretty,\\nflowery garden, set with wooden benches and tables ready for picnic\\nparties. It was a suitable spot for a halt; everyone felt warm with the\\nwalk, and disposed to welcome the sight of cups and saucers.\\n\\n\"How sweet it is here!\" said Alison to Dorothy. \"Something smells\\nperfectly delicious--I don\\'t know what.\"\\n\\n\"I think it must be honeysuckle down by the river.\"\\n\\n\"Then let us go and see. It\\'s rather early for honeysuckle; I haven\\'t\\nfound any out yet. It might perhaps be a sweetbrier. Tea isn\\'t quite\\nready, so we shall have plenty of time.\"\\n\\nThe two girls strolled out of the garden and down a short lane that led\\nto the river. It was beautiful there--the grassy banks were white with\\ntall, lacy, umbelliferous plants, and groups of willows drooped their\\npicturesque, shimmering boughs over the water.\\n\\n\"Look at the old weir,\" said Alison. \"I believe there used to be a mill\\nhere once, only it isn\\'t working now. Dorothy, what\\'s that growing in\\nthe river? Isn\\'t it water plantain?\"\\n\\n\"It looks uncommonly like it.\"\\n\\n\"I must have a piece--I positively must! How can we get some? Do you\\nthink we could walk along the edge of the weir and reach it? It\\'s only a\\nfew yards off.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say we might, if we could hold on to those willows.\"\\n\\n\"Let us try. Give me your hand.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s rather slippery,\" said Dorothy, as she essayed to follow.\\n\\nCatching on to the branches of a willow, the two girls stepped\\ncautiously along the uncovered stones at the edge of the weir towards\\nthe spot where the water plantain was growing so temptingly.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a splendid piece almost within reach,\" said Alison. \"Stick\\ntight to my hand, Dorothy, and I\\'ll bend over. I\\'m within an inch of\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"Be careful!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"Don\\'t pull!\"\\n\\nBut her warning came too late. Alison, in her effort to grasp the\\nplantain, put her weight on her friend, and to support the strain\\nDorothy leaned backwards. Alison, snatching a piece of the flower,\\nsuddenly released the tension; the pair swayed for an instant,\\noverbalanced, and then slipped, shrieking, down the sloping side of the\\nweir.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\nA Confession\\n\\n\\nThe two girls sank into the pool below, then, rising to the surface,\\ncaught with frantic fingers at a rotten willow bough that overhung the\\nwater. Neither could swim, and in desperate plight they clung to the\\nfrail and insecure support. Almost choked with their dipping, their hair\\nand clothes streaming, they still managed to call vigorously for help.\\nBut already their weight was splitting the decayed old willow: there was\\nan ominous crack, a sudden rending, a piteous cry, and, still clutching\\nthe severed branch, they went whirling down the river. Mercifully their\\nfirst wild shriek had been heard, and a farmer who lived at the old\\nmillhouse by the weir had come running instantly from his garden. He\\narrived on the scene just as the branch broke, and wading into the water\\nhe contrived to catch Dorothy, who was the nearer, and to drag her into\\nsafety. But when he turned to look for her companion, Alison had drifted\\nalong with the stream, and was out of his reach. He could not swim, so\\nhe ran back towards the inn, shouting for help. At the sound of his\\ncries the stable boy and several others came rushing down the field.\\n\\n\"Fetch a rope!\"\\n\\n\"Where\\'s the boat?\"\\n\\n\"Cut a long pole!\"\\n\\n\"She\\'ll drown while you\\'re doing it!\"\\n\\n\"For Heaven\\'s sake don\\'t let her go down again!\"\\n\\n\"I can only swim a few strokes, but I\\'ll try if I can reach her,\"\\nexclaimed the stable boy, flinging off his coat and plunging into the\\nriver, which was shallow for a yard or so at the edge.\\n\\nVenturing out of his depth, he grasped Alison by her dress, then turned,\\nfloundering hopelessly towards the bank. For a moment it seemed as if\\nboth lives must surely be lost, but with a desperate effort the boy\\nmanaged to keep himself afloat, and to reach the hand of one of the men\\nwho had waded out to meet him. Between them they pulled the unconscious\\ngirl from the water and laid her on the grass.\\n\\n\"She\\'s gone!\"\\n\\n\"No, no; I\\'ve seen worse than her as came round.\"\\n\\n\"Take \\'em both into the inn and send Sam on his bike for the doctor.\"\\n\\nThe first intimation of the accident which Miss Carter received was the\\nsight of Dorothy walking dripping wet up the garden, followed by a\\ngroup of men carrying Alison. She was a woman of sound, practical\\ncommon sense, and after the first momentary shock was over she set to\\nwork at once to administer treatment for the drowning, with the help of\\nthe other members of the Guild who were present. Their combined efforts\\nwere so successful that by the time the doctor arrived they had\\nsucceeded in restoring animation.\\n\\nDorothy, rolled up in hot blankets, was little the worse for her\\nimmersion, and did not need attention; but the medical man looked grave\\nwhen he saw Alison.\\n\\n\"She is suffering from severe collapse. Have you sent for her mother?\"\\nhe asked.\\n\\nMiss Sherbourne and Mrs. Clarke had both been summoned by telegram. They\\ndrove up within five minutes of each other. Poor Mrs. Clarke\\'s frantic,\\nwhite-lipped agony was terrible to witness.\\n\\n\"You must save her! She\\'s all I have in the world!\" she cried, turning\\ndesperately, almost fiercely, upon the doctor.\\n\\n\"Madam, I use my utmost skill, but life and death are in greater hands\\nthan mine,\" he replied.\\n\\nFor many hours Alison\\'s life trembled in the balance. The district nurse\\nhad been sent for, and with the doctor watched the case anxiously all\\nnight through. At length, when morning dawned, a turn came for the\\nbetter.\\n\\n\"Let her sleep now and she\\'ll do,\" said Dr. Hall to the nurse. \"Can\\'t\\nwe get her mother out of the room somehow?\"\\n\\n\"Miss Sherbourne is downstairs. I know her, and I dare say she will\\nhelp,\" suggested the nurse.\\n\\nAunt Barbara had also spent the night at the inn, partly because she\\nthought it wiser to let Dorothy keep warm in bed, instead of attempting\\nto remove her; and partly because she felt she could not leave till she\\nknew that Alison was out of danger. She had sat up, hoping that she\\nmight be of assistance, though she had not liked to intrude her presence\\ninto the sick-room until she was asked. She came now at the nurse\\'s\\nrequest, and gently persuaded poor worn-out Mrs. Clarke to go downstairs\\nand have some hot tea, which the inn-keeper\\'s wife had made ready.\\n\\n\"It is better to leave the room in absolute quiet for a while,\" she\\nsaid. \"Nurse is keeping watch, and indeed the doctor says there is no\\nfurther cause for anxiety.\"\\n\\nMrs. Clarke\\'s hand shook as she held her cup.\\n\\n\"I can hardly realize yet that she is safe. Oh, if you knew how I have\\nsuffered! My head is on fire. I want to go out into the air,\" she\\nreplied pantingly.\\n\\nThe light was breaking clearly in the east, and Miss Sherbourne opened\\nthe front door. The two women stepped together into the garden.\\n\\n\"Everything seems quiet,\" said Mrs. Clarke, looking up at Alison\\'s\\nwindow. \"You are sure, if there is the slightest change, that Nurse will\\ncall me? Then let us walk across the lawn. I want to talk to you. I must\\nspeak now--at once, while I have the courage.\"\\n\\n\"Shall we sit here?\" said Miss Sherbourne, indicating a bench that faced\\nthe dawn.\\n\\nThe hour was strangely beautiful. The sky, flushing in tints of rose and\\nmauve, heralded the rising sun; the bushes were still masses of rich,\\nwarm shadow, but a group of turn-cap lilies stood out fair and golden\\nagainst the dark background, shedding their heavy fragrance around. A\\nthrush had begun to stir in the laburnum tree, and piped his fine mellow\\nnotes; and a blackbird answered from the elm opposite. The world was\\nwaking to another day of wonderful, pulsing life.\\n\\n\"Weeping and heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the\\nmorning,\" murmured Aunt Barbara softly.\\n\\nMrs. Clarke sat for a few moments gazing at the quiet scene. She was\\nstill intensely agitated, and kept clasping and unclasping her hands\\nnervously upon her knee.\\n\\n\"I must speak,\" she began again hurriedly. \"If I do not tell you now,\\nthe resolution may go. When I saw my darling lie there, at the very gate\\nof death, I knew it was a judgment upon me for my long silence--my\\ncriminal silence.\"\\n\\nShe paused, as if scarcely able to continue. She was weeping bitterly,\\nand her restless fingers pulled to pieces a rose that she had plucked\\nfrom a bush as she passed.\\n\\n\"I hardly know how to explain everything,\" she went on at last, \"but\\nperhaps it will make it clearer if I begin at the beginning, and relate\\nthe story of my life. Have you the patience to hear it? My sister\\nMadeleine and I were twins. My mother died in our infancy, and left no\\nother children, so we two were everything to each other. My father was a\\nclever but eccentric man, a student and an astronomer. He had never been\\nfond of company, and after my mother\\'s death he shut himself up more\\nclosely than ever, and became quite a recluse, devoting himself entirely\\nto his books and his telescope. Though he was fond of us in his way, we\\ndid not see much of him, and he was always so reserved and silent that\\nwe were shy and constrained in his presence. When we were old enough to\\nleave school, our life at home, in a remote country grange, with little\\nsociety to be had in the neighbourhood, was dull and triste in the\\nextreme. Just after our twenty-first birthday, we made the acquaintance\\nof two brothers who were staying at a house in the adjoining parish, and\\nthe friendship soon ripened into a warmer feeling on both sides.\\n\\n\"David Clarke, the elder, fell in love with my sister Madeleine, and\\nHerbert, the younger, with myself. When we broached the subject to my\\nfather, however, he professed great indignation, and forbade either of\\nthe young Clarkes to come to the house. It was extremely arbitrary and\\nunjust of him to behave thus, for he had no reasonable objections to\\nraise against them. I can only imagine that he was annoyed that he had\\nnot been taken earlier into our confidence, and hurt that we wished to\\nleave him. Perhaps, also, he may have had some other matrimonial\\nprojects in his mind for us, though he never made the slightest attempt\\nto introduce us to any suitable friends. Can you imagine the situation?\\nTwo impulsive, motherless girls in the lonely old house, with no one to\\ncounsel us or help to smooth away any of our difficulties! Our lovers\\nhad business in India, and were shortly leaving the country; and the\\nidea of parting from them was terrible to us. They pleaded and urged, so\\nwhat wonder that there were clandestine meetings, and that one morning\\nwe took the law into our own hands and made a double runaway match of\\nit? We were both of age, and could therefore legally marry whom we\\nchose.\\n\\n\"We tried to make peace with our father after the weddings, but he\\nutterly refused to see us, and we were obliged to start for India\\nwithout having received his forgiveness. Within a year we had news of\\nhis death. I think he had been in failing health for some time, and\\nperhaps on that account had been the more loath to part with us; but he\\nhad shown us so little tenderness that we had never realized that he\\nwished for our sympathy or affection. Now that I have a child of my own,\\nI regret that I was not a better daughter to him. In his will he showed\\nthat he had not pardoned either us or our husbands. He left only a small\\nannuity each to Madeleine and myself, and the bulk of his estate in\\ntrust for his first grandchild. My sister Madeleine\\'s little girl was\\nborn a fortnight before mine, so it was she, and not Alison, who\\ninherited her grandfather\\'s fortune. I was very angry at the injustice\\nof the proceeding. It seemed to me monstrously unfair that my little\\none, because she came into the world a fortnight too late, should be\\ndeprived of what in all equity ought to have been hers. I was the elder\\nof the twins, and I considered that any preference should have been in\\nmy favour. I was anxious to bring a lawsuit, and try to upset the will\\nand cause the estate to be equally divided between my sister and myself,\\nbut our solicitor assured me I had no legal case, and should only\\ninvolve myself in endless proceedings and costs. Madeleine and I were\\ntoo much attached to each other to have an open quarrel, and before her\\nI managed to hide my bitter disappointment. We were about to be\\nseparated, for my husband was returning to England, while hers was still\\nremaining in India. I was thankful afterwards that we had parted on such\\ngood terms, for I never saw her again. Only a few days after our steamer\\nstarted she succumbed to a sudden epidemic of cholera that swept over\\nthe place where they were living, and the telegram announcing her death\\nmet me at Port Said. I had loved her dearly, and the blow was cruel. But\\nthere was a harder one still in store for me. My husband, whose ill\\nhealth had been the cause of our leaving India, became rapidly worse,\\nand before I even realized the extent of the danger, he too was taken\\nfrom me. In a single year I had lost father, sister, and husband, and at\\ntwenty-three I found myself a young widow, with an only child.\\n\\n\"At this juncture my brother-in-law, David Clarke, returned to England,\\nbringing his motherless baby in charge of an ayah. He did not intend to\\nstay, only to settle a few necessary business matters and to make some\\narrangement for his little girl, who was delicate, and could not be\\nreared in India. He had no near relations of his own who were willing to\\nbe troubled with the child, so he asked me if I would undertake to bring\\nher up with mine, and I accepted the charge. I was drawn to little\\nRosamond for her mother\\'s sake, though I could never forgive her for\\nbeing a fortnight older than her cousin. So everything was settled. I\\ntook a house in Scotland for the summer, which I thought would be\\nhealthy for the children, and I sent Alison on there in advance with her\\nown nurse. The ayah who had brought Rosamond from India was to return in\\nthe same ship as my brother-in-law, who was starting immediately for\\nMadras. He wanted to see his baby till the very last, so I accompanied\\nhim to London, taking with me Mrs. Burke, a respectable woman who had\\nonce been a maid at my father\\'s house, and was now married, to act as\\ntemporary nurse after the ayah\\'s departure.\\n\\n\"When the last good-byes were said, and my brother-in-law and the ayah\\nhad started, I found I wished to do some shopping in London before I\\nwent north. It is awkward and inconvenient to keep a baby at a hotel, so\\nI determined to send Mrs. Burke with my little niece to Scotland, where\\nmy own responsible nurse was already settled in charge of Alison. I took\\nthem to the station and saw them safely off in the express. In a few\\ndays I intended to follow them. That very night, as I sat at dinner in\\nthe hotel, I heard the newsboys shouting \\'Special edition\\', and learnt\\nof a terrible northern railway smash. I set off by the first available\\ntrain for the scene of the disaster. It was impossible to get beyond\\nBurkden, for the line was disorganized, but I hired a carriage and went\\non to Greenfield. The first point to be ascertained was whether my niece\\nwas among the victims. I wasted some time enquiring at the railway\\noffices, and it was not till late in the afternoon that I saw a\\nnewspaper poster with the heading: \\'Baby\\'s Wonderful Escape from the\\nAccident\\'. It was only after further investigations and delays that I\\nlearnt the child was being taken care of by its rescuer at the Red Lion\\nHotel. Do you remember how I came into the inn parlour that evening? The\\nscene is stamped vividly upon my memory. You sat by the fireside with\\nthe baby on your knee; the light falling from the hanging lamp above\\nmade a picture of you both. It had taken a fancy to you, though it was\\nalways shy with me, and its soft little cheek was pressed against your\\nface. I looked at it, and I think if it had given one sign of\\nrecognition, or held out its arms to me, I should have claimed it. But\\nit took no notice at all, and my heart hardened against it. A terrible\\ntemptation assailed me. If I disowned the baby, nobody would ever know\\nits identity. It would be so easy to tell its father that it had\\nperished in the fire; there could be no positive evidence about any of\\nthe victims of the disaster. If it were out of the way, then my baby\\nwould inherit the fortune which I had always considered was my due. I\\nwas not left well off, and money meant so much to me. I had not been\\nbrought up to study economy, and I hated to be poor. I am a good judge\\nof character, and I knew from your face that you would not abandon the\\nchild you had saved. I thought Fate had interfered forcibly, and had\\ngiven it into your keeping instead of mine. At the moment it seemed to\\nme a direct interposition of Providence, and a sign that my father\\'s\\ninheritance was not intended to be lost to me after all. Before me stood\\na great choice--the good of my sister\\'s little one, or my own--and I\\nchose my own. The sequel proved easy--only too easy. I said the baby I\\nhad seen at the inn was not my niece, and nobody doubted my word. My\\nbrother-in-law and the ayah were already on their way to India, Mrs.\\nBurke was dead, and no one else was likely to raise the question of\\nidentity. The portrait circulated in the newspapers was such a poor\\nsnapshot that neither my nurse nor any of Mr. Clarke\\'s relations\\nrecognized it. They had not known the child intimately; they had only\\nseen her once or twice in her ayah\\'s arms. Before I left the Red Lion at\\nGreenfield I ascertained your name--I scarcely knew why; it seemed an\\ninstinct at the moment. I wished to forget it, but it remained all the\\nsame--one of those things which it is impossible to wine from one\\'s\\nremembrance.\\n\\n\"Years went by, years of prosperity, for in trust for Alison I was a\\nrich woman. I tried to banish all thoughts of Rosamond, and to justify\\nmy action to myself, yet in my inmost heart I knew I had sinned. For\\nsome time I lived in the Midlands, but Leamstead did not suit my little\\ngirl\\'s health, so I removed to Latchworth. When Alison started to go to\\nthe College and I first saw Dorothy in the train, I was immediately\\nstruck with her appearance. I could not think of whom she reminded me;\\nher eyes haunted me continually. One day I came home and found that she\\nhad been at our house in my absence, and that Alison was full of her\\nresemblance to the portrait of my sister Madeleine which hung in the\\ndrawing room. Then I knew, even without the extra links that made the\\nconnection only too plain--the story of her adoption, which Alison had\\nheard at school; the very name of Dorothy Greenfield, and your name,\\nwhich I had not succeeded in forgetting. Alarmed at the recognition, I\\nforbade Alison to invite her again, and in every way in my power\\ndiscouraged the acquaintance between the two girls. I thought of\\nremoving from Latchworth, but I had taken my house on a lease and spent\\nmuch on improving it. Everything appeared to conspire against me: first\\nAlison\\'s extreme affection for Dorothy, then our meeting at the Hydro.,\\nwhere my brother-in-law, unaware of her identity, was so charmed with\\nhis daughter. Then came Alison\\'s visit to your cottage on the afternoon\\nwhen I fetched her in the pony trap. I at once recognized your servant\\nas the one I had seen in the inn parlour at Greenfield, and I could tell\\nby her face that she remembered me. It seemed as if Fate, whom I thought\\nI had conquered so successfully, was dogging my footsteps. I felt my\\nposition was most unsafe, and only yesterday afternoon I definitely\\ndecided to sacrifice the improvements I had made at Lindenlea and to\\nremove to the south of England, where there would be no further chance\\nof Dorothy crossing our path.\\n\\n\"As if in direct consequence of my determination followed this terrible\\naccident. It seemed to me like Heaven\\'s vengeance on my sin. Was my\\ninnocent child to suffer as the scapegoat for my wrongdoing? I vowed to\\nGod that if in His mercy He would spare her life, I would make a full\\nconfession and reparation, no matter what it cost me. There, I have told\\nyou the whole. Do you despise me utterly? Can you possibly ever forgive\\nme that I deliberately thrust the child upon you, and let you bear so\\nheavy a burden all this time? Her own father will be only too thankful\\nto take her now.\"\\n\\nMiss Sherbourne\\'s face was turned towards the golden streak of dawn. For\\na few moments she was silent.\\n\\n\"We have both so much to be thankful for this morning, that it makes it\\neasier to forgive,\" she said at last. \"Yes, the wrong must be righted,\\nand father and daughter restored to each other; but I am glad I was able\\nto keep my little Dorothy for my own those fourteen happy years.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\nThe William Scott Prize\\n\\n\\nDorothy, who was little the worse for her dangerous experience, went\\nhome on the morning following the accident, but it was several days\\nbefore Alison was able to be removed from the inn. She was not a strong\\ngirl, and the fright and immersion combined had produced a state of\\ncomplete exhaustion. The quiet and rest which the doctor prescribed had,\\nhowever, their due effect, and by the end of a week she began to seem\\nher old self again. The surprise of the two girls when later they learnt\\nthe news of their relationship can be imagined. Mrs. Clarke wrote to her\\nbrother-in-law, making a full avowal of everything; and though at first\\nhe found it hard to grant her the forgiveness she implored, his delight\\nat finding his daughter alive outweighed his anger at the long and cruel\\ncourse of deception that had been practised upon him. For the sake of\\nAlison, to whom he was much attached, he allowed himself to be\\nreconciled to his sister-in-law, and agreed to forget the past and let\\nbygones be bygones. Both he and Miss Sherbourne decided emphatically\\nthat Mrs. Clarke\\'s share in the story must be kept a strict secret among\\nthemselves; it was most undesirable that either Dorothy or Alison should\\nknow of the dishonourable part she had played. To both the girls and the\\noutside public it was enough to announce, without detailed explanations,\\nthat the mystery of Dorothy\\'s parentage had been solved. Martha, the\\nonly other person who had guessed at the facts of the situation, could\\nbe safely trusted to preserve silence.\\n\\n\"I shall not at present claim for my daughter the fortune which is\\nlegally hers,\" said Mr. Clarke. \"I do not need it, for I have been very\\nsuccessful financially in India, and am now in comfortable circumstances\\nand able to retire from business. I could not see my brother\\'s child in\\npoverty, so the trust money must still be devoted to Alison\\'s benefit.\\nWhen Rosamond is twenty-one, and of age to decide such matters for\\nherself, I hope that she will agree to divide the legacy equally with\\nher cousin, and thus set right what was originally a most unjust will.\"\\n\\nTo Dorothy the discovery was both a delight and a pain. It removed the\\nstigma that she considered had formerly attached to her, and placed her\\nin the position of other girls as regarded name and family; but it had\\ncertain drawbacks which must be faced. Though she welcomed her\\nnewly-found father, she clung passionately to the one friend who had\\nhitherto made the sum of her life.\\n\\n\"Aunt Barbara has brought me up and done everything for me. I can\\'t\\nleave her. I\\'ve promised to work for her and take care of her when I am\\nold enough,\" she said earnestly.\\n\\n\"I know, child. I know what we owe her. You and I will look after Aunt\\nBarbara together,\" replied Mr. Clarke.\\n\\nDorothy\\'s news made a great sensation at the College. The romantic story\\nappealed to the girls, and congratulations poured in upon her. Even Hope\\nLawson and Valentine Barnett waxed cordial.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve never had such an excitement at school before,\" declared Ruth\\nHarmon. \"It\\'s the most interesting thing I\\'ve ever come across in my\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\"We don\\'t know what to call you now,\" laughed Mavie Morris. \"You\\'re\\nDorothy Greenfield, alias Rosamond Clarke. Which is it to be?\"\\n\\n\"Dorothy Greenfield, please, till the end of the term. Next session my\\nnew name can be entered on the College register, and I\\'ll start in a\\nfresh character.\"\\n\\n\"Then in the meantime we\\'ll call you Rosador, as a compromise.\"\\n\\nThere was very little of the term left now, for the examinations were to\\nbegin the next week, and after those were over would come the annual\\nspeech day, which always concluded the school year. Dorothy\\'s studies\\nhad naturally been somewhat upset by the recent course of events, but\\nshe had made an extra spurt at her work, and did not feel herself ill\\nprepared. She rather liked examinations. She had a clear head and a good\\nmemory, and a neat, concise method of setting forth her information.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s quite inspiring to see a pile of fresh sheets of foolscap\\nand a paper of questions,\" she declared.\\n\\n\"Yes, if you can answer the questions,\" returned Mavie. \"It\\'s a\\ndifferent matter if one\\'s stumped. I\\'m utterly against the competitive\\nsystem.\"\\n\\nDorothy laughed.\\n\\n\"State your reasons, Mavie,\" urged Ruth Harmon. \"We\\'ll set \\'The\\nCompetitive System\\' as a subject for the Debating Society.\"\\n\\n\"Well, to begin with, emulation is the wrong spirit in which to promote\\nwork.\"\\n\\n\"A grand sentiment--but nothing would promote work in you, you dear old\\nlazybones, so it\\'s no use arguing the point.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. If I\\'m content to absorb my knowledge in homeopathic doses,\\nwhy must I be worried into swallowing more than I can digest? If I were\\nrunning a school I\\'d allow the clever girls who wanted to go in for\\nexams, to take them, and let the others alone. I call it sheer cruelty\\nto put the ordinary rank and file on the rack. Next week will be\\npurgatory to me. You\\'ll see me pining day by day, and gradually wasting\\naway.\"\\n\\nIn spite of Mavie\\'s forebodings, she survived the ordeal of the\\nexamination, and presented her usual appearance of robust health at the\\nend of the dreaded period.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve done badly, though,\" she protested. \"I expect I\\'ve failed in at\\nleast half my subjects. The maths. was detestable and the geometry\\nsimply wicked. Rosador, you\\'re looking very smug. I believe you liked\\nthe papers.\"\\n\\n\"They weren\\'t bad, as papers go,\" returned Dorothy. She did not care to\\nboast, but she was conscious that she had done well, and reached a mark\\nfar above her average standard.\\n\\n\"Still, one never knows,\" she thought. \"Exams. are uncertain things, and\\nheaps of other girls may have done better than I have. I just won\\'t\\nthink about the results.\"\\n\\nGovernors\\' Day, as it was popularly called, was always rather a grand\\noccasion at Avondale. The school was a famous one in the town, and\\nnumbered among its pupils many who came from the best families in\\nColeminster. The governors liked to assure the parents that the College\\nwas keeping up its well-earned reputation for efficiency, and to give\\nsome opportunity for a general exhibition of the work done during the\\nyear. With this end in view, the programme was representative of all\\nbranches of the curriculum. A show of drawings, paintings, and\\nhandicrafts done by the art classes was on view in the studio; the\\ncollections of pressed flowers and natural objects made in connection\\nwith the Nature Study Union were put up round the walls of the museum;\\nand the Charity Basket garments contributed by the Ambulance Guild were\\nspread out in the Juniors\\' Common Room. There were to be recitations in\\nFrench and German, songs and instrumental music, speeches by the\\ngovernors, and the head mistress\\'s report on the examination results and\\nthe general progress of the whole school.\\n\\n\"I like the dear old Coll. when it\\'s turned upside down like this,\" said\\nRuth Harmon, who, with Dorothy, had been told off as a steward for the\\noccasion. \"What a fearful cram! The people are simply pouring in. I\\ndon\\'t know how we\\'re to find seats for everybody.\"\\n\\n\"It is amazing how many the room will hold,\" said Dorothy. \"They\\'re\\nbringing in more chairs, and people will have to sit very close together\\non the benches.\"\\n\\nDorothy was looking charming that afternoon, with an unwonted colour in\\nher cheeks, and her fluffy brown hair tied back with a blue ribbon that\\nmatched the tasteful dress her father had provided for her. All the old\\nangularity had slipped away from her lately, and a new graciousness and\\nsweetness had taken its place.\\n\\n\"Dorothy Greenfield is like a hard, tight bud that has suddenly opened\\ninto a flower,\" commented Miss Carter, who was quick to notice the\\nimprovement.\\n\\nThe lecture hall was filling rapidly with guests, and the stewards had\\nto be indefatigable in their exertions.\\n\\n\"I want to be here, there, and everywhere at once,\" said Ruth. \"I wish I\\nwere a conjurer, and could contrive two chairs out of one. Someone is\\nsmiling at you near the door, Dorothy.\"\\n\\nIt was Percy Helm, who, with his father and mother and Eric, was making\\nhis way through the crush. Dorothy went to meet them and find them\\nplaces.\\n\\n\"Gabrielle is on the platform with the chorus, and Norma is among her\\nown Form,\" she whispered.\\n\\n\"And where are you going to sit?\" asked Percy.\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m a wandering Jew at present. I shall slip in somewhere at the\\nlast.\"\\n\\nPromptly at three o\\'clock the proceedings began, and Dorothy, her duties\\nover for the present, found a corner that had been reserved for her on\\nthe platform. From her seat she had a very good view of the hall. How\\npretty it looked, she thought, with its decorations of flags and\\nflowers, and its throng of interested faces! In the fifth row, not very\\nfar away, she could see her father with Mrs. Clarke, and dear Aunt\\nBarbara. Dr. and Mrs. Longton were also present, and the Vicar of\\nHurford and his wife. The Helms were beaming at her from the back row.\\n\\n\"All my best friends are here to-day,\" said Dorothy to herself.\\n\\nThe first part of the programme was musical; glees were sung by picked\\nmembers of the singing classes, and a few solos, both vocal and\\ninstrumental, were given. Alison, who had been taking violin lessons,\\nplayed in a quartette and acquitted herself very creditably, in spite of\\na sudden panic of bashfulness. She came and sat beside Dorothy as soon\\nas her part was finished.\\n\\n\"I\\'m so thankful it\\'s over,\" she whispered. \"I do so hate doing anything\\nin public. I could see Mother looking at me all the time; I believe she\\nwas as nervous as myself. My hand shook so dreadfully at first, I could\\nhardly hold my bow.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind, it sounded quite right,\" replied Dorothy. \"Everybody\\napplauded, especially Father.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I saw Uncle David clapping hard. When are the exam. lists to be\\nread? Have you heard?\"\\n\\n\"Not until after the interval, so Miss Pitman says. They\\'re to come with\\nthe speeches.\"\\n\\nThe recitations passed off well, Grace Russell, the only member of the\\nUpper Fourth who took part in them, distinguishing herself particularly.\\n\\n\"Grace is A1 at languages,\" commented Alison. \"She gets that tripping\\nFrench accent most beautifully.\"\\n\\nAt four o\\'clock there was an interval, and the audience adjourned for\\ntea and to see the exhibits. Alison\\'s collection of pressed flowers was\\namong those on view in the museum, and she bore off her particular\\ncircle of friends to look at it.\\n\\n\"It\\'s got \\'Highly Commended\\',\" she remarked gleefully. \"Uncle David,\\nthat\\'s the very piece of rock rose you climbed up the cliff to pick for\\nme--don\\'t you remember it? Miss Sherbourne, you sent me that catchfly\\nfrom Hurford. I got most of my flowers at Latchworth, and just a few\\nfrom Beechfield. Do you recognize this? It\\'s the water plantain. The\\ninnkeeper at Longacre brought me a big bunch of it just before I left.\\nWasn\\'t it kind of him? I keep it as a specimen, and as a memento of my\\ndipping as well.\"\\n\\nAlison spoke brightly. She had not been told how serious her collapse\\nhad been after her rescue from the river; and she little knew what an\\nimportant share the water plantain had played in bringing about the\\nhappy reunion between her uncle and cousin.\\n\\n\"Dorothy has \\'Commended\\' for her drawing from the cast,\" she continued,\\ndragging Uncle David to the other side of the room. \"Isn\\'t it good? It\\'s\\nthe head of Clytie up there, so you can see how like it is. And we\\'ve\\nboth got \\'Neatly Rendered\\' for our Guild garments. Yes, yes, Uncle; you\\nmust come and see them, even if you don\\'t know anything about sewing.\\nMine\\'s the flannel jacket, and Dorothy\\'s is the child\\'s nightdress. We\\ndid every stitch of them ourselves.\"\\n\\n\"Did you bake the cake that has just disagreed with me at tea?\" enquired\\nMr. Clarke, with a twinkle in his eye.\\n\\n\"No, you naughty man! We don\\'t have cookery classes. When we do, I\\'ll\\ntake care to bring something home, and insist upon your eating it, every\\ncrumb. Now, we\\'ve shown you all our exhibits, and we must go downstairs\\nagain and take our places. The speechifying is going to begin directly.\"\\n\\nThe second part of the programme represented the real business of the\\nafternoon. Alderman Herbert, the chairman of the committee of the\\nCollege, gave an opening address upon the general aims and objects of\\nthe system of education pursued at the school; and this was followed by\\nMiss Tempest\\'s report on the work done during the year. Then came the\\nexamination lists. Dorothy listened eagerly. She had done well,\\ncertainly; but until the final scores were read, it was impossible to\\ncompare her results with those of the top girls in other Forms. She was\\nthe best in the Upper Fourth, but probably one of the divisions of the\\nSixth might be able to produce an even higher record.\\n\\nAt the end of the lists Miss Tempest paused.\\n\\n\"Before continuing,\" she said, \"I should like to give a word of\\nexplanation as to the terms upon which the William Scott Memorial is\\nawarded. It is a prize which was bequeathed by the founder of the\\nCollege to be given annually to whichever girl has gained the highest\\npercentage of marks in the examinations. This year the honour falls to\\nthe Upper Fourth Form, where Dorothy Greenfield has gained 987 out of a\\npossible 1000.\"\\n\\nDorothy listened like one in a dream. She could scarcely believe the\\nevidence of her own ears. But it was true, for Alison was nudging her,\\nand the other girls were whispering to her to \"go forward\". Very shyly\\nshe rose and walked to the front of the platform, where Alderman Herbert\\nwas beckoning her.\\n\\n\"I think we may all congratulate the lucky winner of the William Scott\\nMemorial,\" he said, laying a kindly hand on Dorothy\\'s shoulder. \"Such\\nsuccess can only be the result of hard work and sustained effort. The\\nUpper Fourth may well be proud of its record. I have much pleasure, my\\ndear, in presenting you with this watch, which has been chosen for the\\nprize.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke, he handed Dorothy a morocco case, and taking the beautiful\\nlittle blue-enamelled watch from its satin bed, he pinned it on to her\\ndress. The audience broke into a storm of applause. Dorothy had grown\\npopular lately among the girls, and many of their parents had heard of\\nthe strange circumstances of her loss and finding. She received quite an\\novation as she stood, smiling and blushing, by the side of the chairman.\\n\\n\"I\\'m so delighted,\" exclaimed Alison, as Dorothy returned to her place.\\n\"Let me look. Oh, what a ducky little watch! It\\'s the prettiest I\\'ve\\never seen. But it isn\\'t _that_ I care about so much--it\\'s the honour of\\nwinning. To think that our Form has got the Memorial! You dear, clever,\\nindustrious busy bee! I can\\'t tell you how proud I am you\\'re my\\nrelation.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad my last appearance as Dorothy Greenfield has been a favourable\\none,\" laughed Dorothy. \"Next term I shall be on the school register as\\nRosamond Clarke.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAnd here we must take leave of the cousins, for their story is all\\ntold. Mr. Clarke has bought a charming house at Latchworth, and is very\\nbusy furnishing it so that it may be ready for a certain occasion to\\nwhich he is looking forward greatly. He is tired of Indian life, and has\\ndecided to settle down permanently in England. Dorothy is keenly\\ninterested in her new home, and especially pleased that it is so near to\\nLindenlea, and that she and Alison can still travel by train together to\\nthe College. As for Aunt Barbara, before the summer is over Dorothy will\\nhave learnt to call her by a dearer name still, and Holly Cottage will\\nbe to let.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTranscriber\\'s Notes:\\n\\nPunctuation has been standardised.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n'"
